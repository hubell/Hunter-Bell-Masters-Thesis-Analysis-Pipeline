The Minister for Employment may lay down more detailed regulations on the construction of a health and safety organisation in certain sectors or types of enterprise. <br /><br /><strong>6a.</strong> In enterprises with 10-34 employees, cooperation on health and safety shall be organised in a health and safety organisation composed of one or more supervisors and one or more elected health and safety representatives, with the employer or a representative of the employer as chairman. The health and safety organisation shall be responsible for both day-to-day and overall tasks relating to health and safety. <br /><br /><strong>6b.</strong> In enterprises with 35 or more employees, cooperation shall be organised such that a health and safety organisation is established with the following two levels:</p>

The number shall also be stipulated such that it is possible for the employees to discuss health and safety conditions within their working hours with health and safety representatives and supervisors in the health and safety organisation. There shall be at least as many health and safety representatives as supervisors in the health and safety organisation. <br /><br /><strong>6d.-(1)</strong> Every year the employer shall, in collaboration with the employees and the supervisors, organise the content of cooperation on health and safety for the forthcoming year and establish how this is to take place. In enterprises with a health and safety organisation, such organisation of the content of cooperation shall involve this. <br /><br />(2) Each year, the employer in enterprises with 1-9 employees, cf. section 6, shall discuss with the employees and supervisors whether the necessary technical knowledge about health and safety is present in the enterprise. <br /><br />(3) The employer shall ensure that a competence-development plan is prepared for members of the health and safety organisation regarding supplementary health and safety training, cf. section 9. <br /><br />(4) The Minister for Employment may lay down more detailed regulations about the duties of the employer pursuant to subsections (1)-(3) and the documentation required to satisfy these. <br /><br /><strong>6e.-(1)</strong> The Minister for Employment may lay down more detailed regulations on how the health and safety organisation at an enterprise is to be constituted and function, how the number of members of the health and safety organisation is to be established, election of health and safety representatives, and election and appointment of supervisors in the health and safety organisation, as well as the tasks of the health and safety organisation. <br /><br />(2) Where it is deemed unnecessary or inexpedient to organise cooperation on health and safety pursuant to the regulations in sections 6a-6c, section 6d(1) and section 8(3), the Minister for Employment may, for certain trades, sectors or work sites, grant exemptions from the said regulations. <br /><br /><strong>7.-(1)</strong> The provisions of sections 6a-6c, and section 6d(1) shall not apply insofar as, in order to enhance cooperation in the enterprise on health and safety</p>
<ol>
<li>an agreement has been established between one or more employee organisations and the corresponding employer organisation(s), or employers or those authorised for such purpose, and</li>
<li>enterprises subject to an agreement established under no. 1, have established an agreement between the employer and the employees at the enterprise, or employees at part of the enterprise.</li>
</ol>
<p>(2) The employer shall be able to document for the Working Environment Authority that the enterprise is subject to an agreement pursuant to subsection (1). <br /><br />(3) The Minister for Employment may lay down more detailed regulations on conditions under which sections 6a-6c, and section 6d(1) may be derogated from through agreements established in accordance with subsection (1). Furthermore, the Minister for Employment may lay down more detailed regulations on how agreements pursuant to subsection (1) are to be established. <br /><br />(4) Questions of interpretation and violations of the agreements established pursuant to subsection (1) shall be resolved according to the usual industrial procedure for the area. Violations of agreements established pursuant to subsection (1), no. 2 may not, however, be brought before the Danish Labour Court, but they shall be settled by industrial arbitration. <br /><br /><strong>7a.-(1)</strong> A health and safety organisation may cover</p>
<ol>
<li>several operationally linked enterprises,</li>
<li>several employers at the same work site, or</li>
<li>municipalities or regions and independent institutions, which have established operational collective agreements.</li>
</ol>
<p>(2) Organisation pursuant to subsection (1) is conditional upon</p>
<ol>
<li>establishment of an agreement pursuant to section 7, and</li>
<li>representation in the health and safety organisation by each of the participating enterprises.</li>
</ol>
<p>(3) The Minister for Employment may lay down more detailed regulations on how and under what circumstances agreements pursuant to subsections (1) and (2) may be established, and on representation by the participating enterprises in a health and safety organisation for several enterprises. <br /><br /><strong>7b.</strong> The tasks of the health and safety organisation may, if agreed between the enterprise and its employees, be extended to include environmental issues directly connected to the enterprise. The Minister for Employment may lay down more detailed regulations which ensure resolution of the health and safety issues of the enterprise. <br /><br /><strong>8.-(1)</strong> The employer shall ensure that members of the health and safety organisation are provided with reasonable time, in the circumstances, to carry out their duties on health and safety work. <br /><br />(2) The employer shall provide the members of the health and safety organisation with opportunity to acquire the necessary knowledge and training on health and safety issues. <br /><br />(3) The employer shall provide the members of the health and safety organisation with opportunity to participate in planning insofar as matters of health and safety at the workplace are concerned. <br /><br />(4) The employer shall provide the members of the health and safety organisation with opportunity to coordinate their work. <br /><br /><strong>8a.</strong> The Minister for Employment may lay down more detailed regulations on the rights and duties of the members of the health and safety organisation. <br /><br /><strong>9.-(1)</strong> The employer shall ensure that members of the health and safety organisation have completed a compulsory course on health and safety of three-daysâ duration within three months of their election or appointment. Subsequently, the employer shall offer members of the health and safety organisation supplementary courses on health and safety in the first year corresponding to two daysâ duration and, in each of the following years of the period of office, corresponding to one-and-a-half daysâ duration. It shall be possible to complete the first two days of supplementary health and safety training within the first 12 months of the period of office. <br /><br />(2) The Minister for Employment shall lay down more detailed regulations on content, enrolment, offer and completion of the compulsory health and safety training, the supplementary health and safety training and special health and safety training for coordinators of health and safety work within the building and construction sector, as well as the qualifications of teachers and approval and quality assurance of providers of the compulsory health and safety training and the special health and safety training for coordinators. <br /><br /><strong>10.-(1)</strong> The employer shall pay all expenses in connection with the activities of the health and safety representative and shall indemnify the health and safety representative for loss of earnings. <br /><br />(2) The health and safety representative shall enjoy protection against dismissal and any other impairment of his conditions in the same way as shop stewards within the same or any similar sector. <br /><br />(3) Disputes concerning protection under subsections (1) and (2), including questions of what regulations to apply and breach of or interpretation of the regulations, shall be settled by the normal procedure for settling industrial disputes, cf. section 33 of the Danish Labour Court Act. <br /><br /><strong>11.</strong> If a supervisor in the health and safety organisation is dismissed following the end of a probationary period and one of the parties alleges that the dismissal was due to conditions relating to safety, his employment shall not be terminated during the period of notice until the matter has been subjected to consultation by the organisations according to the regulations of the relevant collective agreement or examined in accordance with the regulations of the Employers' and Salaried Employees' Act on negotiation and arbitration. Negotiation and arbitration shall be expedited as much as possible.<br /><br /><strong>11a.</strong> When visiting the enterprise, the Working Environment Authority shall normally contact relevant health and safety representatives and supervisors in the health and safety organisation. These shall be free to submit to the Authority all questions concerning health and safety.</p>
<h3>Advice</h3>
<p><strong>12.</strong> If the employer does not have the necessary expertise to undertake the health and safety work of the enterprise, the employer shall seek external expert assistance with a view to ensuring the continued health and safety of the employees. The Minister for Employment may lay down more detailed regulations on this matter. <br /><br /><strong>13.</strong> (Repealed). <br /><br /><strong>13a.</strong> (Repealed). <br /><br /><strong>13b.</strong> (Repealed). <br /><br /><strong>13c.</strong> The Minister for Employment shall lay down regulations on the authorisation of health and safety consultants including the obligation to use necessary expertise when the Working Environment Authority so imposes, cf. section 77a(1).</p>
