        the project, and the potential the project has to reduce

[[Page 136 STAT. 2031]]

        or displace, on a lifecycle basis, United States greenhouse gas

total proposed cost of the project, except that such Federal share shall 
increase to 90 percent of the total proposed cost of the project if the 
eligible entity is a small hub airport or nonhub airport, as such terms 
are defined in section 47102 of title 49, United States Code.
