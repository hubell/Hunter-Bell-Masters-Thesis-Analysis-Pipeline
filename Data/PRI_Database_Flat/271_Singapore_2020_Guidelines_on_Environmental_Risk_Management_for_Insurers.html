Proved Reserves are those quantities of petroleum, which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be commercially recoverable, from a given date forward, from known reservoirs and under defined economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations.

Probable Reserves are those additional Reserves that are less likely to be recovered than Proved Reserves but more certain to be recovered than Possible Reserves. It is equally likely that actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater than or less than the sum of the estimated Proved Reserves plus Probable Reserves (2P). In this context, when probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 50% probability that the actual quantities recovered will equal or exceed the 2P estimate; and</div><div class="list">(iii) "Possible Reserve" is an incremental category of estimated recoverable volumes associated with a defined degree of uncertainty. Possible Reserves are those additional reserves which analysis of geoscience and engineering data suggests are less likely to be recoverable than Probable Reserves.

                <p>  An applicant may consult the Exchange to resolve specific issues prior to the submission of an application. Unless the Exchange prescribes otherwise, the following sets out the usual main steps in the listing process:&#8212;</p><div class="list">  (1) The applicant submits (to the Listings Function) one copy of the listing application prepared in compliance with Rules <a href="/node/4930">245</a> and <a href="/node/4931">246</a>;</div><div class="list">  (2) The Exchange considers whether the application satisfies the listing requirements and will decide whether to issue an eligibility-to-list letter (with or without conditions). Listing will not be permitted until all conditions set out in the eligibility-to-list letter have been satisfied;</div><div class="list">  (3) Where a prospectus or offering memorandum is required to be issued, the applicant lodges the prospectus or offering memorandum with the relevant authority (if applicable) and submits a copy to the Exchange. The lodged copy of the prospectus should not be materially different from the prospectus or offering memorandum on which the eligibility-to-list letter was issued. The applicant must submit a written confirmation to the Exchange to this effect. If there are material differences, the Exchange may withdraw the eligibility-to-list letter;</div><div class="list">  (4) The Exchange will inform the applicant of any further information (additional to what is prescribed) that is required to be disclosed prior to commencement of trading. The applicant decides whether to include this information in its prospectus or offering memorandum, or to make pre-quotation disclosure through an announcement to the Exchange. Pre-quotation disclosure must be made not later than the market day before trading commences. Preferably, it should be made before the launch of the offer;</div><div class="list">  (5) If the listing entails an offer of securities to the public, the applicant invites applications to subscribe for or purchase the securities. After the offer closes, the applicant announces the outcome of the offer, and where appropriate, the level of subscription and the basis of allocation and allotment, and the subscription rate reflecting the true level of demand for the offer. In computing the subscription rate, subscriptions by connected persons and the persons mentioned in <a href="/node/4920">Rule 240</a> must be excluded;</div><div class="list">  (6) On satisfaction of the conditions expressed in the eligibility-to-list letter, the issuer is admitted to the Official List at the discretion of the Exchange. Trading of its listed securities commences on a date determined by the Exchange either on a deferred settlement basis or ready basis or such other basis as the Exchange may approve.</div>

Approval for listing of the additional shares is not an indication of the merits of the transaction; and</div><div class="list">(4) The Exchange must be notified immediately if, before the commencement of dealing in any equity securities which are the subject of an application, the issuer becomes aware that:&mdash;<div class="list">(a) There has been a significant change affecting any matter contained in the application; or</div><div class="list">(b) A significant new matter has arisen, which would have been required to be included in the application if it had arisen before the application was submitted.</div></div><p>For the purpose of this rule, "significant" means significant for the purpose of making an assessment of the activities, assets and liabilities, financial position, management and prospects of the group, and of its profits and losses and of the rights attaching to the securities.</p>

                <div class="list">(1) The Exchange will not normally accept a confidential additional listing application. However, an issuer may submit a confidential application for listing of shares to be issued pursuant to an underwritten rights issue, with the view to reducing underwriting exposure. When submitting a confidential application, the issuer must be able to maintain confidentiality of the issue. The issuer must announce the issue if it appears that there has been a leakage of information on the issue.</div><div class="list">(2) An issuer making a confidential listing application for an underwritten rights issue must observe the following listing procedures:&mdash;<div class="list">(a) The issuer must appoint a lead manager and underwriter. The listing application must state the indicative price range at which the issue will be made. The underwriting agreement is normally signed after the Exchange has approved the listing of the new securities.</div><div class="list">(b) Upon receipt of approval in-principle from the Exchange, the issuer must promptly finalise the terms of the issue with the lead manager/underwriter. The issue and its finalised terms must be announced as soon as possible, and in any case, not later than 48 hours after the receipt of approval in-principle from the Exchange.</div><div class="list">(c) In the event of leakage of information, as suggested by market rumours or unusual activities in the issuer's shares, the issuer must take one of the following steps:&mdash;<div class="list">(i) Announce the issue immediately.</div><div class="list">(ii) Request temporary suspension of trading pending finalisation of terms. Thereafter, the terms would be announced. The Exchange would normally expect the announcement to be made within two days of the temporary suspension of trading.</div><div class="list">(iii) Withdraw the issue and make an appropriate announcement.</div><div class="noindent">The issuer and the lead manager are expected to investigate the possible sources of leakage and submit their findings to the Exchange.</div></div><div class="list">(d) In organising an underwriting syndicate, an issuer and its lead manager must be particularly mindful of the need to prevent leakage of information. To minimise the risk of leakage, the issuer and lead manager must restrict the number of staff and other professionals having access to the confidential information.

                <h2>Appendix 7.1 Corporate Disclosure Policy</h2>
            </a>
                        <div class="node-body">
                <p><em>Cross-referenced from <a href="/node/5068">Rule 703</a>(4)</em></p><p><strong>Part I Introduction</strong></p><div class="list">1 This Appendix sets out the Exchange's corporate disclosure policy.</div><div class="list">2 <a href="/node/5068">Rule 703</a>(4)(a) obligates an issuer to provide timely disclosure of material information in accordance with this policy. The Exchange regards disclosure as fundamentally important to the operation of a fair and efficient market for the trading of securities.</div><p><strong>Part II Issuers' Obligations Under Rule 703</strong></p><div class="list">3 Under <a href="/node/5068">Rule 703</a>, an issuer must disclose information:—<div class="list">(a) necessary to avoid the establishment of a false market in its securities. A false market may exist if information is not made available that would, or would be likely to, influence persons who commonly invest in securities in deciding whether or not to subscribe for, or buy or sell the securities. For this reason, an issuer may be required to clarify or confirm a rumour (see "Clarification or Confirmation of Rumours or Reports" below); or</div><div class="list">(b) that would be likely to have a material effect on the price or value of securities of that issuer.</div></div><div class="list">4 Material information includes information, known to the issuer, concerning the issuer's property, assets, business, financial condition and prospects; mergers and acquisitions; and dealings with employees, suppliers and customers; material contracts or development projects, whether entered into in the ordinary course of business or otherwise; as well as information concerning a significant change in ownership of the issuer's securities owned by insiders, or a change in effective or voting control of the issuer, and any developments that affect materially the present or potential rights or interests of the issuer's shareholders.</div><div class="list">5 The fact that information is generally available is not a reason for failing to disclose under <a href="/node/5068">Rule 703</a>. For example, if an issuer releases material information to the media but did not announce it to the market via SGXNET, the issuer is in breach of <a href="/node/5068">Rule 703</a>. <a href="/node/5066">Rule 702</a> requires an issuer to make announcements via SGXNET, unless specified otherwise.</div><div class="list">6 It is the responsibility of each issuer to disclose material information in its possession as required by the listing rules.</div><div class="list">7 Information must not be divulged to any person (outside of the issuer and its advisers) in such a way as to place in a privileged dealing position any person. Information must not be released in such a way that transactions in the issuer's listed securities (whether on market or off market) may be entered into at prices which do not reflect the latest publicly available information.</div><div class="list"><strong>8 Some Events Requiring Disclosure Under Rule 703</strong><br /><br />Under <a href="/node/5068">Rule 703</a>, the following events, while not comprising a complete list of all the situations which may require disclosure, are likely to require immediate disclosure:—<div class="list">(a) A joint venture, merger or acquisition;</div><div class="list">(b) The declaration or omission of dividends or the determination of earnings;</div><div class="list">(c) Firm evidence of significant improvement or deterioration in near-term earnings prospects;</div><div class="list">(d) A subdivision of shares or stock dividends;</div><div class="list">(e) The acquisition or loss of a significant contract;</div><div class="list">(f) The purchase or sale of a significant asset;</div><div class="list">(g) A significant new product or discovery;</div><div class="list">(h) The public or private sale of a significant amount of additional securities of the issuer;</div><div class="list">(i) A change in effective control or a significant change in management;</div><div class="list">(j) A call of securities for redemption;</div><div class="list">(k) The provision or receipt of a significant amount of financial assistance;</div><div class="list">(l) Occurrence of an event of default under debt or other securities or financing or sale agreements;</div><div class="list">(m) Significant litigation;</div><div class="list">(n) A significant change in capital investment plans. Examples include building of factories, increasing plant and machinery, and increasing production lines;</div><div class="list">(o) A significant dispute or disputes with sub-contractors, customers or suppliers, or with any parties;</div><div class="list">(p) A tender offer for another company's securities;</div><div class="list">(q) A valuation of the real assets of the group that has a significant impact on the group's financial position and/or performance. The valuation of real property must be carried out by a property valuer in accordance with the property valuation standards. A copy of the valuation report, or for real property, a copy of the property valuation report, must be made available for inspection at the issuer's registered office during normal business hours for 3 months from the date of the announcement;</div><div class="list">(r) Involuntary striking-off of the issuer's subsidiaries;</div><div class="list">(s) An investigation on a director or an executive officer of the issuer;</div><div class="list">(t) Loss of a major customer or a significant reduction of business with a major customer; and</div><div class="list">(u) Major disruption to supply of critical goods or services.</div></div><p><strong>Part III Exception to Rule 703</strong></p><div class="list">9 <a href="/node/5068">Rule 703</a> includes two exceptions from the requirement to make immediate disclosure. One allows information not to be disclosed if to do so breaches the law (<a href="/node/5068">Rule 703</a>(2)). The other allows an issuer to temporarily refrain from publicly disclosing particular information, provided that the information is of a certain type, a reasonable person would not expect it to be disclosed and the information is kept confidential (<a href="/node/5068">Rule 703</a>(3)).</div><div class="list">10 An issuer can rely on the exception under <a href="/node/5068">Rule 703</a>(3) while each of the three conditions is satisfied. Should any of the conditions cease to be satisfied, the exception will similarly cease to be available, and the issuer must disclose the information immediately. The three conditions are:—<br /><br /><strong>Condition 1: A reasonable person would not expect the information to be disclosed</strong><div class="list">(a) A reasonable person would not expect information to be disclosed if such disclosure would prejudice the ability of the issuer to pursue its corporate objective. Also, a reasonable person would not expect the disclosure of an inordinate amount of detail.</div><div class="list">(b) If conditions 2 and 3 are satisfied but a reasonable person would expect the information to be disclosed, the exception is not available. In considering if this condition is satisfied, the Exchange will balance the needs of the market and the interests of the issuer while having regard to the principle on which the listing rule is based.</div><br /><strong>Condition 2: The information is confidential</strong><br /><br />Generally, information may be regarded as confidential if the issuer has control of the use that can be made of the information. Confidentiality also means that no one in possession of the information is entitled to trade in that issuer's listed securities. In this regard, unusual activity in the issuer's securities may suggest that the information is no longer confidential. If so, this condition is not met. (See also "Confidentiality")<br /><br /><strong>Condition 3: The information is of the type in one of the listed categories.</strong><br /><br />If the information is not of the type in one of the listed categories, or if it loses that character, then the condition is not satisfied.</div><p><strong>Part IV Examples of the Operation of Rule 703</strong></p><div class="list">11 The following examples explain in more detail the operation of <a href="/node/5068">Rule 703</a>. They illustrate the general principles only and do not affect the operation of the listing rule.<div class="list">(a) <strong>Example (1): Information concerning an incomplete proposal or negotiation</strong><br /><br />In the course of a successful negotiation for the acquisition of another company, for example, the only information known to each party at the outset may be the willingness of the other to hold discussions. Shortly thereafter, it may become apparent to the parties that it is likely an agreement can be reached. Finally, agreement in-principle may be reached on specific terms. In such circumstances, an issuer need not issue a public announcement at each stage of the negotiations, describing the current state of constantly changing facts but may await agreement in-principle on specific terms. If, on the other hand, progress in the negotiations should stabilise at some other point, disclosure should then be made if the information is material.</div><div class="list">(b) <strong>Example (2): Information generated for internal management purposes</strong><br /><br />Disclosure of an issuer's internal estimates or projections of its earnings or of other data relating to its affairs is not necessary. If such estimates or projections are released, they should be prepared carefully, be soundly based and should be realistic. The estimates or projections should be qualified, if necessary, to ensure that they are properly understood. Should subsequent developments indicate that performance will not match earlier estimates or projections, this too should be reported promptly and the variances adequately explained.</div></div><p><strong>Part V Confidentiality</strong></p><div class="list">12 Where an issuer relies on <a href="/node/5068">Rule 703</a>(3) to temporarily withhold material information, the strictest confidentiality must be maintained. Access to the information should be restricted, to the extent possible, to the highest possible levels of management and should be disclosed to officers, employees and others only on a need-to-know basis. Distribution of paperwork and other data should be kept to a minimum.</div><div class="list">13 It may be appropriate to require each person who gains access to the information to report to the issuer, any transaction which he effects in the issuer's securities.</div><div class="list">14 During this period, the issuer should keep a close watch on the trading activity of its securities and be prepared to make an immediate public announcement if necessary.</div><p><strong>Part VI Clarification or Confirmation of Rumours or Reports</strong></p><div class="list">15 Public circulation of information, whether by an article published in a newspaper, by a broker's market letter, or by word-of-mouth, either correct or false, which has not been substantiated by the issuer and which is likely to have, or has had, an effect on the price of the issuer's listed securities or would be likely to have a bearing on investment decisions must be clarified or confirmed promptly.</div><div class="list">16 If rumours indicate that material information has been leaked, a frank and explicit announcement is required. This is because one of the conditions for withholding information, i.e. confidentiality of the information, is no longer fulfilled. If rumours are in fact false or inaccurate, they should be promptly denied or clarified. A statement to the effect that the issuer knows of no corporate developments that could account for the unusual market activity can have a salutary effect. In addition, a reasonable effort should be made to bring the announcement to the attention of the party that initially distributed the information (in the case of an erroneous newspaper article, for example, by sending a copy of the announcement to the newspaper's financial editor, or in the case of an erroneous market letter, by sending a copy to the broker responsible for the letter). If rumours are correct or there are developments, an immediate statement to the public as to the state of negotiations or corporate plans in the rumoured area must be made. Such statements are essential despite the business inconvenience which may result, even if the matter had yet to be presented to the issuer's board of directors for consideration.</div><div class="list">17 In the case of a rumour or report predicting future sales, earnings or other data, no response from the issuer is ordinarily required. However, the issuer must make a prompt announcement so that the market remains properly informed if the rumour or report is materially incorrect and may mislead investors, or is specific enough to suggest that information came from an inside source, or the market moves in a way that appears to be referable to the rumour or report.</div><p><strong>Part VII Unusual Trading Activity</strong></p><div class="list">18 Where unusual trading activity in an issuer's securities occurs without any apparent publicly available information which could account for the activity, it may signify trading by persons who are acting on unannounced material information or on a rumour or report, whether true or false. Unusual market activity may not be traceable either to insider trading or to a rumour or report. Nevertheless, the market activity itself may be misleading to investors, who may assume that a sudden and appreciable change in the price of the issuer's securities reflects a corresponding change in its business or prospects.</div><div class="list">19 Similarly, unusual trading volume, even when not accompanied by a significant change in price, tends to encourage rumours and give rise to excessive speculative trading activity which may be unrelated to actual developments in the issuer's affairs.</div><div class="list">20 In such situations, the issuer should undertake a review to seek the causes of the unusual trading activity in its securities. The issuer should consider whether any information about its affairs, which would account for the activity, has recently been publicly disclosed, whether there is any material information that has not been publicly disclosed (in which case, the unusual trading activity may signify that a "leak" has occurred), and whether the issuer is the subject of a rumour or report. The issuer should respond promptly to any enquiries made by the Exchange concerning the unusual trading activity and may be guided by the following:—<div class="list">(a) If the issuer determines that the unusual trading activity results from material information that has been publicly disseminated via SGXNET, generally no further announcement is required. However, if the market activity indicates that such information may have been misinterpreted, it may be helpful, after discussion with the Exchange, to issue an announcement to clarify the matter;</div><div class="list">(b) If the unusual trading activity results from the "leak" of material information, the information in question must be announced promptly. If the unusual trading activity results from a false rumour or report, the Exchange's policy on correction of such rumours and reports, (discussed in "Clarification or Confirmation of Rumours or Reports") should be observed; and</div><div class="list">(c) If the issuer is unable to determine the cause of the unusual trading activity, the Exchange may suggest that the issuer makes a public announcement to the effect that there have been no undisclosed recent developments affecting the issuer or its affairs which would account for the unusual trading activity.</div></div><p><strong>Part VIII Policy on Thorough Public Dissemination</strong></p><div class="list">21 Material information must be disclosed when it arises, even if during trading hours. The Exchange will expect the issuer to request a trading halt to facilitate the dissemination of the material information during trading hours. As a guide, a trading halt requested for dissemination of material information will last at least 30 minutes after the release of the material information, or such other period as the Exchange considers it appropriate. The request for a trading halt, and the request for the lifting of a trading halt, must be announced. There must be at least 15 minutes of dissemination time for an announcement on the request for the lifting of trading halt, before trading resumes. The issuer may request a temporary suspension if it is unable to release the material information by the end of the trading halt. Otherwise, the Exchange will consider whether a temporary suspension in trading of the issuer's securities is necessary to enable the material information to be properly disseminated. As a guide, the temporary suspension may last 30 minutes after the announcement has been released to the Exchange, or such other period as the Exchange considers it appropriate. The request for a suspension in trading, and the request for the resumption of trading from suspension, must be announced. There must be at least 30 minutes of dissemination time for an announcement on the request for the resumption of trading from suspension, before trading resumes.</div><div class="list">22 Public disclosure of material information must be made by an announcement released to the Exchange via SGXNET. To facilitate the dissemination of information, copies of the announcement may be provided simultaneously to newspapers and newswire services.</div><div class="list">23 The Exchange recommends that issuers observe an "open door" policy in dealing with analysts, journalists, stockholders and others. However, under no circumstances should disclosure of material information be made on an individual or selective basis to analysts, stockholders, or other persons unless such information has previously been fully disclosed and disseminated to the public. If material information is inadvertently disclosed at meetings with analysts or others, it must be publicly disseminated as promptly as possible by the means described in this Part.</div><div class="list">24 The Exchange recognizes that there may be limited instances where selective disclosure is necessary. One example is the pursuit of the issuer's business or corporate objectives, such as when the issuer is undertaking a major corporate exercise. Another example is due diligence when the issuer is the subject of an acquisition. In these circumstances, selective disclosure may be required to facilitate the exercise. However, such disclosure should be made on a need to know basis and subject to appropriate confidentiality restraints.</div><p><strong>Part IX Content and Preparation of Public Announcement</strong></p><div class="list">25 The content of a press release or other public announcement is as important as its timing. Each announcement should:—<div class="list">(a) be factual, clear and succinct;</div><div class="list">(b) contain sufficient quantitative information to allow investors to evaluate its relative importance to the activities of the issuer;</div><div class="list">(c) be balanced and fair. Thus, the announcement should avoid:—<div class="list">(i) omission of important unfavourable facts, or the slighting of such facts (for example by "burying" them at the end of a press release);</div><div class="list">(ii) presentation of favourable possibilities as certain, or as more probable than is actually the case;</div><div class="list">(iii) presentation of projections without sufficient qualification or without sufficient factual basis;</div><div class="list">(iv) negative statements phrased to create a positive implication, for example, "The company cannot now predict whether the development will have a materially favourable effect on its earnings," (implying that the effect will be favourable even if not materially favourable), or "The company expects that the development will not have a materially favourable effect on earnings in the immediate future," (implying that the development will eventually have a materially favourable effect);</div><div class="list">(v) use of promotional jargon calculated to excite rather than to inform; and</div><div class="list">(vi) in periodic updates on performance, selective presentation of information without sufficient comparability across periods. For example, a company should not publish performance measures that are inconsistent across periods to highlight favourable performance or omit poor performance in selected periods;</div></div><div class="list">(d) avoid over-technical language, and should be expressed to the extent possible in language comprehensible to the layman; and</div><div class="list">(e) explain the consequences or effects of the information on the issuer's future prospects. If the consequences or effects cannot be assessed, explain why.</div></div><div class="list">26 The following guidelines for the preparation of press releases and other public announcements should help issuers ensure that the content of such announcements meet the principles discussed in paragraph 25:—</div><div class="list">(a) Every announcement should be prepared or reviewed by (i) an official of the issuer familiar with the matters to be disclosed, and (ii) an official of the issuer familiar with the requirements of the Exchange and any applicable requirements of securities laws;</div><div class="list">(b) Since skill and experience are important to the preparation and editing of accurate, fair and balanced public announcements, the Exchange recommends that a limited group of individuals within the issuer be given this assignment on a continuing basis; and</div><div class="list">(c) Review of press releases and other public announcements by legal counsel is often desirable or necessary, depending on the importance and complexity of the announcement.</div><p><strong>Part X Policy on Insider Trading</strong></p><div class="list">27 Issuers and parties who may be regarded as insiders should be fully aware of the provisions in any applicable legislation on insider trading.</div><div class="list">28 Persons who come into possession of material information, before its public release, are considered insiders for the purposes of the Exchange's corporate disclosure policies. Such persons include substantial shareholders, directors, executive officers and other employees, and frequently also include the issuer's lawyers, accountants, bankers, investment bankers, public relations consultants, advertising agencies, consultants, valuers and other third parties. The associates (as defined in "Definitions and Interpretation") of, and those under the control of, insiders may also be regarded as insiders. Where an issuer is involved in the negotiation of an acquisition or transaction, the other parties to the negotiation may also be regarded as insiders.</div><div class="list">29 Issuers should make insiders (and others who have access to material information on the issuer before it is publicly disclosed) aware that trading in the issuer's securities while in possession of undisclosed material information or tipping such information is an offence under Singapore's securities laws and may also give rise to civil liability. Issuers are advised to refer to Rule 1207(19) which provides guidance on the principles and best practices with regard to dealings by the issuer and its officers in the issuer's securities.</div><div class="list">30 Issuers should establish, publish and enforce effective procedures applicable to the purchase and sale of the securities of the issuer and listed members of its group by officers, directors, employees and other insiders. The procedures should be designed not only to prevent improper trading, but also to avoid any question of the propriety of insider purchases or sales.</div><p><strong>Part XI Role of Market Surveillance</strong></p><div class="list">31 An issuer should monitor the trading in its securities to detect any unusual trading activity. Where such unusual trading activity is observed, issuers should note Part VII above. The Exchange also monitors trading of listed securities. Where there is unusual trading activity in a listed security, and it appears to the Exchange that the unusual trading activity cannot be explained by known factors, the Exchange may require the issuer to make an announcement. The announcement should, inter alia, state whether the issuer and its directors are aware of the reasons for the unusual trading activity and whether there is any material information which has not been publicly disclosed. If the issuer or its directors are aware of any matters concerning the substantial shareholders that may account for the unusual trading activity, they must take this into consideration when responding to any query by the Exchange.</div><p><em>Amended on <a class="alias-file-path" href="/net_file_store/SGX_Mainboard_Rules_February_7_2020.pdf" target="_blank">7 February 2020</a><a class="raw-file-path" href="/sites/default/files/net_file_store/SGX_Mainboard_Rules_February_7_2020.pdf" target="_blank">7 February 2020</a>, <a class="alias-file-path" href="/net_file_store/SGX_Mainboard_Rules_February_7_2020_ii.pdf" target="_blank">7 February 2020</a><a class="raw-file-path" href="/sites/default/files/net_file_store/SGX_Mainboard_Rules_February_7_2020_ii.pdf" target="_blank">7 February 2020</a> and <a class="raw-file-path" href="/sites/default/files/net_file_store/SGX_Mainboard_Rules_February_12_2021.pdf" target="_blank">12 February 2021</a>.</em></p>

Introduction</strong></p><div class="list">  1.1 This Practice Note discusses the Exchange's role in the current disclosure based regulatory regime and its approach to regulating issuers.</div><p>  <strong>2. Disclosure-Based Regulatory Regime and the Exchange's Role</strong></p><div class="list">  2.1 In October 1998, the Corporate Finance Committee ("CFC") initiated a shift from a merit-based regulatory regime to a predominantly disclosure-based regulatory regime. A disclosure-based regime is premised on the principle that, in general, informed investors can protect themselves. It recognizes that the market is better placed than regulators to decide on the merits of transactions.</div><div class="list">  2.2 In a disclosure-based regime, the principal function of the Exchange is to provide a fair, orderly and efficient market for the trading of securities. In this regard, the Exchange considers disclosure as fundamentally important. The listing rules and the Exchange's regulation of issuers are aimed at promoting, among other things, full, accurate and timely disclosure. The underlying principles of the listing rules include:  <div class="list">    (i) issuers shall have minimum standards of quality, operations, management experience and expertise;  </div>  <div class="list">    (ii) investors and their professional advisers shall be given all information that they would reasonably require to make an informed assessment of the securities for which listing is sought;  </div>  <div class="list">    (iii) issuers shall disclose information if a reasonable person would expect that information to have a material effect on the price or value of their listed securities;  </div>  <div class="list">    (iv) all holders of listed securities shall be treated fairly and equitably; and  </div>  <div class="list">    (v) directors of an issuer shall act in the interests of shareholders as a whole, particularly where a director or substantial shareholder has a material interest in a transaction entered into by the issuer.  </div></div><p>  <strong>3. Regulatory Objectives</strong></p><div class="list">  3.1 Oversight of listed companies is performed by Issuer Regulation ("IR"), part of the Risk Management and Regulation Group. IR aims to establish rules to promote a high standard of corporate governance and transparency by listed companies. IR monitors compliance with its rules.</div><div class="list">  3.2 In considering applications for listing, IR reviews applications for listing, prospectus, offering memoranda, shareholders' circulars and other documents. IR's review is limited to ensuring that all relevant requirements for listing are satisfied. The directors of an issuer have primary responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of the document. While IR does not independently verify the information in the document, it may investigate if it has reason to believe that there is an omission from, or false or misleading disclosure in, the document.</div><div class="list">  3.3 Where continuing disclosure obligations are concerned, IR aims to promote full and timely disclosure of all relevant information by the issuer to the market. The directors of an issuer have primary responsibility for the timeliness, accuracy and completeness of the announcement. While IR does not independently verify the information in the announcement, it may investigate if it has reason to believe that there is an omission from, or false or misleading disclosure in, the announcement.</div><div class="list">  3.4 SGX has established SGX RegCo with effect from 15 September 2017. Functions previously performed by IR, part of the Risk Management and Regulation Group, and succeeding units or functions, will be performed by SGX RegCo.</div><p>  <strong>4. Regulatory Approach</strong></p><div class="list">  4.1 IR currently reviews every disclosure document prior to its issue. The objective of the review is to maintain the standard of disclosure (but not to exercise merit judgment on the transactions). IR also monitors reports by media and announcements made by issuers.</div><div class="list">  4.2 However, responsibility for meeting the standard of disclosure rests on the issuer not IR. With effect from 1 March 2004, IR will adopt a more risk-based approach to regulating issuers. Under this approach, greater regulatory attention is focused on areas that pose significant risks and where market transparency, integrity or investor protection may be compromised if the risks materialize. In determining the low- and high-risk areas, IR has assessed the likelihood of a risk materializing and the impact it may have on IR's ability to meet its objectives. The Exchange will monitor the situation on an on-going basis, and if warranted, low-risk areas may be reclassified as high-risk areas and vice versa.</div><div class="list">  4.3 Under this approach, IR will make the following changes to its functions:&#8212;<br />  <br />  <table class="table" width="100%" cellspacing="1">    <tr>      <td class="table_main">        Function      </td>      <td class="table_main">        Current Procedure      </td>      <td class="table_main">        New Procedure      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td valign="top">        1.

This Practice Note explains:  <div class="list">    &#8226;&#160;&#160; the Exchange's procedure in granting listing,  </div>  <div class="list">    &#8226;&#160;&#160; the circumstances under which the Exchange may withdraw the eligibility-to-list letter,  </div>  <div class="list">    &#8226;&#160;&#160; the principles in dealing with comments the Exchange occasionally receives from the public on listing applications,  </div>  <div class="list">    &#8226;&#160;&#160; general duties regarding due diligence by sponsors and investigative reports,  </div>  <div class="list">    &#8226;&#160;&#160; the sponsorship disclosure requirement post-listing,  </div>  <div class="list">    &#8226;&#160;&#160; director's training and connection to Singapore.  </div></div><p>  <strong>2. Exchange's Procedure</strong></p><div class="list">  2.1 When the Securities & Futures (Offers of Investments) (Shares and Debentures) Regulations 2002 came into effect on <span class="me">1</span> July 2002, the Exchange's approach in reviewing new listing applications changed. The Exchange moved from a merit-based regime towards a disclosure<span class="me">-</span>based regime. Hence, we now concentrate on reviewing the listing application for compliance with the listing requirements (including specific numerical standards and qualitative factors such as the integrity of the management and controlling shareholders of the listing applicants) and disclosure (for trading in the secondary market). The Exchange does not judge (and has never judged) whether the investment would be a good one for investors.</div><div class="list">  2.2 Based solely on the information provided, including representations made at the time of application and in response to any queries from the Exchange, a conditional eligibility-to-list ("ETL") letter will be issued when it appears to the Exchange that the application satisfies the listing requirements. Listing will not be permitted until all conditions set out in the ETL letter have been satisfied.</div><div class="list">  2.3 The Exchange may withdraw the ETL letter at any time and in its absolute discretion before the listing, if:&#8212;  <div class="list">    a. it subsequently becomes aware of any information that is likely to materially affect the issuer's eligibility for a listing. In particular, circumstances having that effect include those that have an adverse material impact on the operations and viability of the issuer or may cast doubt on the integrity of the directors, its management or controlling shareholders; or  </div>  <div class="list">    b. information submitted at the time of application was false or misleading or there is a material omission whether or not such omission was intentional; or  </div>  <div class="list">    c. any subsequent material adverse event occurs that renders the issuer not meeting the listing requirements.  </div></div><p>  <strong>3. Comments Received</strong></p><div class="list">  3.1 The Exchange will give consideration to comments received on the listing application or prospectus from the public (whether anonymous or not).</div><div class="list">  3.2 All comments will be forwarded to the issue manager.</div><div class="list">  3.3 If the comments are anonymous, it would be up to the issue manager to take such actions as it deems fit. However, the Exchange may require the issue manager to investigate and report its findings to the Exchange if:&#8212;  <div class="list">    a. credible material comments regarding the financial information or operations of the issuer are supplied that may affect on the issuer's eligibility for a listing; or  </div>  <div class="list">    b credible material comments supported by evidence are supplied, in particular, comments regarding the integrity of the directors, management or controlling shareholders.  </div></div><div class="list">  3.4 If the comments are not anonymous and appear credible and material, the Exchange will normally expect the issue manager to investigate and report its findings to the Exchange. The Exchange may also carry out its own investigation and, where appropriate, enter into correspondence with the person who sent the comments.</div><div class="list">  3.5 The Exchange may delay the listing until it is satisfied with the findings. The Exchange is not obliged to disclose any findings or its conclusion.</div><div class="list">  3.6 Where the prospectus has been lodged with the Monetary Authority of Singapore ("MAS"), the Exchange will forward a copy of any comments and the issue manager's findings to the MAS for its consideration on whether to register the prospectus.</div><p>  <strong>4. Due Diligence</strong></p><div class="list">  4.1 <a href="/node/9087">Listing Rule 112B</a> provides that an issue manager must:&#8212;  <div class="list">    a. discharge its obligations with due care, diligence and skill;  </div>  <div class="list">    b. in preparing an applicant for a new listing (including an initial public offering, a listing by way of an introduction or a reverse takeover), be satisfied of the various matters set out in <a href="/node/9087">Rule 112B</a>(2)(a) and, conduct adequate due diligence; and  </div>  <div class="list">    c. inform the Exchange of all matters relevant to the listing application that should be brought to the Exchange&#039;s attention in a timely manner.  </div></div><div class="list">  4.2 Issue managers must exercise their own judgment on the nature and extent of due diligence work needed to satisfy themselves and the Exchange. As a sponsor, an issue manager must have knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances concerning an applicant's ability to meet the Exchange's listing requirements. This means that the issue manager will have taken all reasonable steps to verify the facts and, if requested, will readily be able to confirm them to the Exchange. It also means that the issue manager must be in a position to confirm and substantiate its opinions, such as in respect of the integrity of the management and controlling shareholders, or the applicant's viability, or that the accounts are genuine and conform to applicable standards.</div><div class="list">  4.3 Issue managers are also expected to continually review their due diligence processes and procedures to see how they might be refined or improved to meet their obligations under the relevant laws, regulations and SGX&#039;s listing requirements.</div><div class="list">  4.4 [Deleted]</div><p>  <strong>5. Verification</strong></p><div class="list">  5.1 One aspect of an issue manager being able to satisfy the Exchange that it has conducted due diligence may be the existence of independently-sourced information, by a reputable agent, on the applicant or its management or controlling shareholders. The Exchange may request an issue manager to show it the results of any independent verification undertaken.</div><div class="list">  5.2 Without affecting the issue manager's obligation to undertake due diligence, the Exchange may conduct checks using an agency it appoints. This would not normally increase the processing time for the application or add materially to the overall costs of the IPO. The cost would be borne by the applicant. If the Exchange undertook such a check, it would be likely to involve (as circumstances warranted) &#8212;  <div class="list">    a. 2 or 3 key persons, and their personal and business backgrounds and integrity, role in the applicant's business, interests in other companies, and any criminal or other records or links to money laundering or organized crime.  </div>  <div class="list">    b. the applicant's history, structure, accounts, business reputation and development, its related companies, its other businesses, and the influence of key persons.  </div></div><p>  <strong>6. Foreign Applicants' Connection to Singapore</strong></p><div class="list">  6.1 The Exchange looks at the connection to Singapore of every foreign applicant. This is to ensure sufficient local representation and the ability to take steps in the event of a problem. <a href="/node/4886">Rule 221</a> requires a foreign issuer to have a certain minimum number of resident directors. To meet the objective of sufficient connection, residence means either citizenship or permanent residence status.</div><div class="list">  6.2 The assessment of an applicant's connection to Singapore is made on a case-by-case basis, and depends on all the circumstances. In addition to <a href="/node/4886">Rule 221</a>, the Exchange may ask the applicant also to install company secretarial functions here.</div><p>  <strong>7. Compliance Adviser</strong></p><div class="list">  7.1 The Exchange may require an applicant to appoint a compliance adviser for a specified period of time after listing.</div><div class="list">  7.2 The Exchange may require an issuer to appoint a compliance adviser if it breaches the listing rules, particularly if the breaches are repeated or give rise to concerns about the issuer's compliance arrangements.</div><div class="list">  7.3 The compliance adviser is expected to advise the board on the applicable rules and regulations. The Exchange would normally accept a lawyer, a corporate finance adviser or other professional parties, who are familiar with the rules and regulations applicable to a listed company, to be a compliance adviser.</div><p>  <em>Amended on <a href="/net_file_store/SGX_Mainboard_rules_2011_amended2.pdf" target="_blank" class="alias-file-path">29 September 2011</a><a href="/sites/default/files/net_file_store/SGX_Mainboard_rules_September_29_2011_amended2.pdf" target="_blank" class="raw-file-path">29 September 2011</a>, <a href="/net_file_store/SGX_Mainboard_Rules_2020.pdf" target="_blank" class="alias-file-path">10 January 2020</a><a href="/sites/default/files/net_file_store/SGX_Mainboard_Rules_January_10_2020.pdf" target="_blank" class="raw-file-path">10 January 2020</a> and <a href="/net_file_store/SGX_Mainboard_Rules_February_7_2020.pdf" target="_blank" class="alias-file-path">7 February 2020</a><a href="/sites/default/files/net_file_store/SGX_Mainboard_Rules_February_7_2020.pdf" target="_blank" class="raw-file-path">7 February 2020</a>.</em></p>

Issuers should apply the principles outlined in the Practice Note flexibly and sensibly. Issuers are still obliged to make their own judgments when determining whether a particular piece of information is material and requires disclosure. The purpose of timely disclosure of material information is to allow the operation of a fair<span class="me">, orderly and transparent</span> market. The following discussion should be read in that light.</li><li>In case of doubt, issuers are encouraged to consult the Exchange with respect to the application of the rules.</li></ol></li><li>Interaction with the SFA<ol><li>The Exchange's continuous disclosure rules are given statutory backing under Section 203 of the SFA. A breach of the Exchange's continuous disclosure obligations may be considered an offence under the SFA and may have serious legal consequences for the issuer and its officers.</li></ol></li><li>Guidance on what constitutes material information<ol><li><a href="/node/5068">Rule 703</a>(1) requires an issuer to announce any information known to the issuer concerning it or any of its subsidiaries or associated companies which:<ol class="rulebook-alpha"><li>is necessary to avoid the establishment of a false market in the issuer's securities (<a href="/node/5068">Rule 703</a>(1)(a)). <a href="/node/5372">Appendix 7.1</a> explains that a false market may exist if information is not made available that would, or would be likely to, influence persons who commonly invest in securities in deciding whether or not to subscribe for, or buy or sell the securities. Such information may be referred to as “trade-sensitive” information; or</li><li>would be likely to materially affect the price or value of the issuer's securities (<a href="/node/5068">Rule 703</a>(1)(b)). Information would be likely to have such material price impact if it is likely to prompt a significant change in the price or value of the issuer's securities. Such information may be referred to as “materially price-sensitive” information.</li></ol></li><li>Information is considered material and required to be disclosed under <a href="/node/5068">Rule 703</a>(1) as long as it is either trade-sensitive or materially price-sensitive. Issuers must exercise judgment when deciding whether information is material using both these tests. If an issuer is unable to ascertain whether the information is material, the recommended course of action is to announce the information via SGXNET.<br><br><em><span class="me">Materially price-sensitive information</span></em></li><li>The test of whether information is materially price-sensitive is an objective one. Issuers must assess, on an ex-ante basis, if the information is likely to have a material impact to the price of its securities. It requires issuers to foresee how investors will react to any particular information when it is disclosed.</li><li>Issuers' assessment should consider the significance of the information in the context of the issuer's business. Information that might be immaterial to another entity may be material to the issuer, as the impact to the issuer would depend on its business and market expectations of the issuer's performance. Issuers should therefore rely on experience and knowledge of past market impact of similar type of disclosures made under comparable circumstances to form their assessment.</li><li>Issuers should also consider prevailing market conditions in their assessment of price impact. Factors to be considered could include liquidity of the issuer's securities, macroeconomic or sector-specific factors and the general market sentiment. Information that might be considered immaterial during stable macroeconomic and industry conditions but could become material when the industry is undergoing extreme volatility or a protracted downcycle.</li><li>For the purposes of assessing if a breach of <a href="/node/5068">Rule 703</a>(1)(b) has occurred, the Exchange will examine actual market reaction to the information when it is disclosed. If information that is disclosed does not result in a significant change in price of the securities, then it is likely that the information may not be considered to be materially price-sensitive. The Exchange may examine market reaction over a length of time suitable for the liquidity of the securities. For example, if the securities are not actively traded, it may be necessary to look at a longer period of activity.<br><br><em><span class="me">Trade-sensitive information</span></em></li><li>The test for trade-sensitive information does not focus on the potential price impact of information, but rather the likelihood that the omission or failure to disclose such information will result in the market trading on an uninformed basis. Such information must be disclosed to avoid the establishment of a false market in the securities. As set out in the Corporate Disclosure Policy in <a href="/node/5372">Appendix 7.1</a>, a false market may exist if information is not made available that would, or would be likely to, influence persons who commonly invest in securities in deciding whether or not to subscribe for, or buy or sell the securities.</li><li>The test of whether information is trade-sensitive is also an objective one. The question to ask is, is the information expected to influence an investor who commonly invests in securities to subscribe for, or buy or sell the issuer's securities in reliance of that information, if it had been known beforehand? If so, the information is trade-sensitive.</li><li>The term “persons who commonly invest” is defined in Section 214 of the SFA. MAS has also issued guidelines on the interpretation of the term, which set out that the class of investors that are considered “persons who commonly invest” will be product-specific, and will include retail investors for listed shares. The Exchange will employ the same definition and interpretation for the purposes of the Listing Rules.</li><li>For practical purposes, information which is materially price-sensitive would likely also be trade-sensitive. If information has a material price impact, it would also influence investors in their investment decisions. However, trade-sensitive information need not necessarily have a material price impact. For example, information on a transaction may have a neutral effect on share price, but may be considered to be trade-sensitive if the transaction is material to the issuer and likely to influence investors' decision to invest in the securities.</li><li>Therefore, the Exchange's assessment of whether information is trade-sensitive is broader than that for materially price-sensitive information. The test for trade-sensitive information assesses the likelihood that the information, if undisclosed, will cause investors to trade on an uninformed basis. In that regard, the Exchange may consider information to be trade-sensitive, even if there is no significant market reaction to the information when disclosed.</li><li>Issuers should make their own judgment on whether information would be trade-sensitive. In particular, an issuer should consider whether a person who commonly invests in that security would likely trade in the security in reliance of that piece of information. As with the test for materially price-sensitive information, which requires issuers to assess the impact of the information to the price of the issuer's securities, issuers should review the information in the context of the issuer's business as well as prevailing market conditions in making their assessment.</li></ol></li><li>Exceptions to Rule 703(3)<ol><li><a href="/node/5068">Rule 703</a>(3) allows exception from disclosure provided that three conditions are met. These conditions are that (a) a reasonable person would not expect information to be disclosed, (b) the information is confidential and (c) the information either (i) concerns an incomplete proposal or negotiation, (ii) comprises matters of supposition or is insufficiently definite to warrant disclosure, (iii) is generated for internal management purposes, or (iv) is a trade secret. Information should be disclosed if any one of the three conditions is not satisfied.<br><br><em><span class="me">Confidential information</span></em></li><li>Where material, non-public information has been reported but not released via SGXNET, the Exchange will require clarification from an issuer to ensure that the market is trading on accurate information. If information has been reported in a reasonably specific manner or from a reliable identified source, the Exchange is likely to consider that the information is no longer confidential. For example, should the report contain the salient terms of a contract or the information has been attributed to the issuer or a reliable source, this indicates that there may have been a leakage of material information. Leakage of material information would result in a loss of confidentiality and thus an issuer can no longer rely on the confidentiality exemption under <a href="/node/5068">Rule 703</a>(3).</li><li>An issuer is required to announce any material, non-public information that has leaked to the market even though it was covered by the exemptions in <a href="/node/5068">Rule 703</a>(3) (for example, regardless of whether the transaction is still undergoing negotiation). This is regardless of the issuer's original intentions to keep the information confidential. It is therefore important for issuers to put in place strong safeguards to preserve confidentiality of its information. If the issuer is not ready to confirm the information that was leaked or there is too much uncertainty (for example, if the transaction is undergoing negotiation), the issuer should release a holding statement to sufficiently explain its position.</li><li><div>If an issuer is of the view that there has been no leak, but there is unusual market activity that could be attributable to the report, the issuer should release a statement to provide clarity on the actual situation and deny or confirm the matters in the report, even if the statement may be a reiteration of information previously announced. Where there are no media reports, but unusual market activity is observed, the issuer should undertake a review to seek the causes of the unusual market activity and take appropriate action as set out in paragraph 20 of <a href="/node/5372">Appendix 7.1</a>. The issuer should also respond promptly to any queries made by the Exchange concerning the unusual trading activity. Failing which, the Exchange may suspend the issuer's securities from trading.<br>&nbsp;</div><div class="noindent"><blockquote><p><em><span class="me">Positive example:</span></em><br><br><em><span class="me">The Exchange issued a query to an issuer due to unusual market activity observed on the issuer's securities.</span></em><br><br><em><span class="me">The issuer requested a trading halt on the same day, and responded that it had received a non-binding proposal from a third party who had expressed interest to purchase certain businesses of the issuer and was currently in discussions with the third party. The issuer also clarified that as at the date of the announcement, no binding offer has been made and no definitive agreements have been entered into in relation to any merger and acquisition, joint venture or strategic alliance opportunity.</span></em><br><br><em><span class="me">Upon the subsequent confirmation of the transaction, the issuer followed up with another announcement that it had entered into a conditional share purchase agreement for the sale of a certain part of its business to a third party.</span></em></p></blockquote></div></li><li>An issuer must not agree to a confidentiality clause with any other parties, for example as part of contractual terms, which may result in it not being able to comply with the continuous disclosure rules in the Listing Manual. If the test for disclosure under <a href="/node/5068">Rule 703</a> is otherwise met (for example, the entering into of a material agreement), the Exchange will expect the information to be disclosed notwithstanding that the information is confidential or that the issuer has signed a non-disclosure agreement. This requirement does not apply if <a href="/node/5068">Rule 703</a>(2) applies.<br><br><em><span class="me">Rumours or speculation</span></em></li><li>The Exchange generally does not expect issuers to respond to rumours or speculation (including reports predicting future sales, earnings or other data) unless there is a price or volume movement in the market. However, an issuer is expected to clarify the position if the information contained in the report or rumour is reasonably specific to suggest that the information came from an insider or a reliable source. For example, if there are media reports setting out material allegations involving an issuer or its business, its Board or its management, the issuer should, where necessary, request a trading halt and promptly release an announcement to clarify its position.<br><br><em><span class="me">Information concerns an incomplete proposal or negotiation</span></em></li><li>Information that concerns an incomplete proposal or negotiation is excluded on the basis that the likelihood of such agreements proceeding is low or uncertain. Issuers cannot rely on this exception for material developments or arrangements where commitments to or from the issuer have already been made, even if there are expected to be subsequent developments that may change the potential impact.</li><li>For example, if a material transaction is subject to conditions precedent, the issuer must make prompt disclosure when commitment to undertake the transaction is made, even if the conditions precedent have yet to be satisfied. If and when there is subsequent development, issuers should then provide further updates to the market.</li><li><div>As another example, the service or receipt of a letter of demand or the commencement of a lawsuit may require disclosure if the amount or action claimed otherwise has a material impact, notwithstanding that negotiations on the letter of demand may be ongoing or the outcome of the lawsuit is not yet known. This is particularly so if the claim may, so long as it succeeds in part, materially impact the issuer's performance, even if the exact quantum of the claim may still be uncertain. However, if the claim or action could reasonably be characterised as bound to fail (for example, if the issuer has received legal advice to that effect), disclosure may not be necessary.<br>&nbsp;</div><div class="noindent"><blockquote><p><em><span class="me">Negative example:</span></em><br><br><em><span class="me">An issuer received a letter of demand from its lender. The amount owed by the issuer to the lender was substantial. The issuer did not immediately announce the receipt of the letter of demand, nor did it request a trading halt. The issuer said that it was still in negotiations with the lender to seek a time extension to make repayment and hence did not think that disclosure was necessary.</span></em><br><br><em><span class="me">The Exchange determined that the receipt of the letter of demand was material and took disciplinary action against the issuer for failure to disclose the matter promptly. The Exchange considered that the receipt of a letter of demand by the issuer from its lender would be considered material information for the issuer, given the amount owed. The fact that a time extension was being sought should not have altered the decision to disclose immediately, as there was already certainty of the claim. The issuer should have announced the receipt of the letter of demand promptly.</span></em></p></blockquote></div><div class="list"><em><span class="me">Trade secrets</span></em></div></li><li>An issuer also cannot rely on reasons, such as possible erosion of the issuer's competitiveness or unfavourable impact on the issuer's business to avoid complying with the disclosure rules, unless the matter is a trade secret. Trade secrets are intellectual property of the issuer, such as a specific process, system or know-how belonging to the issuer which provides it with a competitive advantage. It does not include general information that can be easily discoverable or observed.</li></ol></li><li>Guidance on particular situations<ol><li>Examples of the types of information that could be material are provided under paragraphs 4 and 8 of <a href="/node/5372">Appendix 7.1</a>. However, no definitive list can be given. What may be considered material to one issuer may not be material to another. Hence each issuer must exercise its own judgment when deciding whether information is material. Apart from considering quantitative factors, an issuer should consider qualitative and circumstantial factors when deciding whether it is necessary to disclose a particular piece of information. These include trading history of the issuer, unexplained change in price or volume of the issuer's shares, volatility of the issuer's shares, operating environment of the issuer, and the total mix of information that is publicly available. As a guiding principle, an issuer should always consider whether a reasonable person would expect the information to be disclosed.<br><br><em><span class="me">Change in the issuer's near-term earnings prospects</span></em></li><li>During the course of preparing its financial reports, an issuer may become aware that the company's financial position will significantly deviate from previously reported results. In such a situation, the issuer should disclose the significant deviation immediately, and not withhold it until the scheduled release of the financial report. This is made clear in paragraph 8 of <a href="/node/5372">Appendix 7.1</a>, which states that where there is firm evidence of significant improvement or deterioration in the near-term earnings prospects, this is likely to be considered material information which must be disclosed immediately. The same obligation also applies if there are material adjustments to the issuer's previously announced financial statements.</li><li>Issuers should take into account the information currently available to the public that might inform investors' expectations on the issuer's future performance. This will necessarily include previous prospect statements made by the issuer in its financial reports.</li><li>Apart from the financial reporting cycle, an issuer may also become aware of material changes to its near-term earnings prospects caused by general trading trends or by specific events or developments during the course of its business which may be likely to materially affect its earnings (for example, a loss of a major customer or disruption to a major supplier). The issuer should assess if such events or developments are material and require immediate disclosure. The issuer should put in place internal controls to escalate material information to the Board expediently for consideration.<br><br><em><span class="me">Ongoing developments</span></em></li><li><div>In certain situations, a matter may still be developing or undergoing further assessment, and issuers may not be able to quantify the impact at the occurrence of the material event. Issuers must still make disclosure of the event without delay. Their announcement should contain sufficient information for investors to understand the potential magnitude of the event and its relevance in the context of the issuer's prospects. Useful information will include a description of the risks or uncertainties and mitigating measures to be taken by the issuer. Issuers should follow up with further announcements to the market when there are subsequent material developments.</div><div class="noindent"><blockquote><p><em><span class="me">Positive example:</span></em><br><br><em><span class="me">A fire occurred at a storage facility of a major supplier of an issuer. The issuer made immediate announcement of the incident on SGXNET, while it was still in the process of assessing the scale of the impact.</span></em><br><br><em><span class="me">In its announcement, the issuer included information on the extent of its reliance on that particular supplier, the immediate impact of the fire to its supply operations and obligations to existing customers, as well as mitigating measures undertaken to minimise impact of the disruption.</span></em><br><br><em><span class="me">The issuer also stated that it was conducting further assessment of the impact, and would provide updates to the market if it is concluded that there is material impact.</span></em></p></blockquote></div><div class="list"><em><span class="me">Investigation on a director or an executive officer of the issuer</span></em></div></li><li>Under <a href="/node/5070">Rule 704</a>(7)(a), an announcement of the appointment of key persons by an issuer must contain material background information as set out in <a href="/node/5424">Appendix 7.4.1</a>. Such information includes, among others, whether the key person has been concerned with the management or conduct of the affairs of any corporation or entity which has been investigated, or the subject of civil or criminal proceedings (including pending proceedings), in each case, involving a breach of law or regulatory requirement as set out in <a href="/node/5424">Appendix 7.4.1</a> relating to the securities or futures industry, or involving fraud or dishonesty.</li><li>Under <a href="/node/5093">Rule 720</a>(1), an issuer must also comply with <a href="/node/4870">Rule 210</a>(5) on a continuing basis, which requires, among others, a consideration of the character and integrity of directors and management.</li><li>Issuers should put in place internal controls to ensure that where directors or executive officers are notified by a regulatory authority, an exchange, a professional body or a government agency (“relevant authority”), that they are to be interviewed or under investigation, such information is escalated expediently to the Board, including the Nominating Committee. The Board should conduct an independent assessment of the matter and not rely solely on the representations made by the director or executive officer. Where investigations are on-going, directors and executive officers must continue to provide updates to the Board on material development relating to the investigations, including the conclusion of investigations, so long as they are not prohibited from doing so by the regulatory requirements.</li><li>In determining whether the information is material for disclosure, the Board should consider, among others:<ol class="rulebook-alpha"><li>whether the information is material to the affairs of the issuer, taking into account factors such as:<ol class="rulebook-roman"><li>the extent to which the interview or investigation concerns the affairs of the issuer or the group;</li><li>the extent to which the issuer is reliant on the director or executive officer for the proper oversight and management of the issuer; and</li><li>the extent to which the director's or executive officer's ability to oversee or manage the issuer is compromised; and</li></ol></li><li>whether the investigation would affect the information previously disclosed in accordance with <a href="/node/5070">Rule 704</a>(7)(a) or the assessment of the character and integrity of the director or executive officer; and</li><li>the severity of the potential breach.</li></ol></li><li>Subject to paragraph 5.9 above, the following events are likely to require immediate disclosure:<ol class="rulebook-alpha"><li>the director or executive officer has been served with an order for the production of documents to assist in an investigation in relation to a breach of law, rule or regulation;</li><li>the director or executive officer was investigated and interviewed by the relevant authority;</li><li>the director or executive officer has surrendered his passport to a relevant authority, has been arrested (with or without posting bail) by a relevant authority, has been formally charged by a relevant authority or a relevant authority has imposed conditions or restrictions on the director or executive officer; or</li><li>the director or executive officer has been convicted or disqualified or is the subject of any judgement or ruling.</li></ol></li><li>To give clarity to such events, an announcement made pursuant to paragraph 5.10 above should contain:<ol class="rulebook-alpha"><li>the name and position of the relevant director or executive officer;</li><li>the relevant fact (for example, that the director has surrendered his passport to the relevant authority) and details of any other conditions or restrictions imposed by the relevant authority, where applicable;</li><li>the alleged offences and the identity of the offender whom the authorities were investigating as stated in the order, where applicable;</li><li>the Nominating Committee’s assessment of the suitability of the continued appointment of the director or executive officer and continued compliance with <a href="/node/5093">Rule 720</a>(1) (read with <a href="/node/4870">Rule 210</a>(5)) as well as the measures (if any) put in place to safeguard against risks associated with his continued appointment, where applicable;</li><li>a statement by the director or executive officer that he undertakes to inform the Board of the ongoing investigation and subsequent developments; and</li><li>the Board’s statement that it will continue to monitor the progress of the investigation and the Nominating Committee will continue to re-assess the suitability of the continued appointment of the relevant director or executive officer as and when there are material developments to the investigation. If no measures to safeguard against risks associated with the retention of such individual are considered necessary by the Board, this should be stated in the announcement, along with the reasons.</li></ol></li><li>Where a person is a director or executive officer in multiple listed issuers, the onus is on the person to notify the Boards of all these listed issuers of his involvement in an ongoing investigation. Where an issuer has been notified by its director or executive officer of his involvement in an ongoing investigation that does not directly concern the affairs of the issuer, the Nominating Committee must still assess the suitability of the continued appointment of the relevant director or executive officer. For instance, the Nominating Committee must assess whether the investigation is material to the issuer, and whether the investigation would affect the assessment of the character and integrity of the director or executive officer. Where the Nominating Committee opines that the investigation is material to the issuer or has a bearing on the character and integrity of the director or executive officer, the issuer must announce the Nominating Committee’s assessment of the suitability of the continued appointment of the relevant director or executive officer and continued compliance with <a href="/node/5093">Rule 720</a>(1) (read with <a href="/node/4870">Rule 210</a>(5)) as well as the measures (if any) put in place to safeguard against the risks associated with his continued appointment. If no measures are considered necessary by the Board, this should be stated in the announcement, along with the reasons.</li><li>Where the Nominating Committee finds that it is not in the best interest of the Company for the relevant director or executive officer to continue with his current appointment, an announcement should be made on the suspension or cessation of service pursuant to <a href="/node/5070">Rule 704</a>(7)(a) and the reason for the suspension or cessation.</li><li>On the other hand, where a relevant conduct has resulted in a private sanction by the relevant authority, such information need not be disclosed as the breach is likely to be of a less serious nature and the relevant authority has deemed it appropriate for the sanction to remain confidential.<br><br><em><span class="me">Investigation on an issuer</span></em></li><li>In the case where the issuer itself is involved in an investigation, the market should similarly be updated in a timely manner. In determining whether the information is material for disclosure, the Board should consider, among others:<ol class="rulebook-alpha"><li>whether the information is material to the affairs of the issuer; and</li><li>the severity of the potential breach.</li></ol></li><li>Subject to paragraph 5.15 above, the following events are likely to require immediate disclosure:<ol class="rulebook-alpha"><li>the issuer has been contacted by a relevant authority or served with an order for the production of documents to assist in an investigation in relation to a breach of law, rule or regulation; or</li><li>the issuer has been informed or becomes aware that any of its subsidiaries or associated companies are under investigation by a relevant authority.</li></ol></li><li>To give clarity to such events, an announcement made pursuant to paragraph 5.15 above should contain:<ol class="rulebook-alpha"><li>the name of the relevant subsidiary or associated company, where applicable;</li><li>the relevant fact and details of any other conditions or restrictions imposed by the relevant authority, where applicable;</li><li>the alleged offences and identity of the offender whom the authorities was investigating as stated in the order, where applicable; and</li><li>the Board’s statement that it will continue to monitor the progress of the investigation and to provide updates on material developments.</li></ol></li></ol></li><li><div>Content of announcements<br>&nbsp;</div><blockquote><p><em><span class="me">Publication of promotional material</span></em></p></blockquote><ol><li>Announcements on SGXNET must be balanced and fair. That is, both the positive and negative aspects of the development or prospects must be disclosed honestly and without bias. Issuers should be cautious not to mislead investors with the presentation or emphasis of certain favourable information, or omission of certain unfavourable key facts.</li><li>In particular, paragraph 25 of <a href="/node/5372">Appendix 7.1</a> states that issuers should avoid the use of promotional jargon in their announcements. This does not mean that issuers should avoid disclosing developments or presenting forward looking information that are positive in nature. For example, a property development company may announce updates of its key projects attaining certain sales milestones; a technology company may announce the launch of a breakthrough product. Such announcements enable investors to assess the impact of such developments on the issuer's business and future prospects. In this regard, issuers should refer to the specific guidance provided in <a href="/node/5372">Appendix 7.1</a>, to ensure that their disclosures meet the requirements of being balanced and fair.</li><li><div>Issuers should also avoid using SGXNET to publish third party research reports that present a favourable valuation of the issuer's shares, with the aim of driving up the share price. The publication of research reports by an issuer could be interpreted as tacit representation that its results will be close to the estimate and will likely be considered by the Exchange as a prospect statement. The report will also be subject to the same requirements as any other announcement from the issuer (for example, it must not mislead investors and must be presented in a balanced and fair manner). In addition, as stated in paragraph 11 of <a href="/node/5372">Appendix 7.1</a>, estimates or projections should be prepared carefully, be soundly based and should be realistic.</div><div class="noindent"><blockquote><p><em><span class="me">Negative example:</span></em><br><br><em><span class="me">An issuer announced a third party research analyst's projected valuation of the issuer's securities. Upon investigation, the Exchange found that the issuer had omitted key facts from the research report in its announcement. In particular, the issuer only presented the most optimistic scenario of the analyst's valuation in the announcement, without sufficient qualification or explanation. The issuer had failed to highlight the range of possible valuation scenarios and key assumptions for each scenario that had been included in the research report.</span></em><br><br><em><span class="me">The Exchange took the view that the issuer was in breach of the Listing Rule requirements for announcements to be balanced and fair and took disciplinary action against the issuer.</span></em></p></blockquote></div><div class="list"><em><span class="me">Sufficient information</span></em></div></li><li>Announcements should contain sufficient detail to allow investors to evaluate the relative importance of the announced information to the issuer. When announcing the award of any contract or new business arrangements, for example distributorships, joint ventures and strategic alliances, an issuer must state clearly the financial impact arising from the transaction or, if there is no material impact, provide a statement to that effect. By providing the financial impact on the issuer, investors will be able to put the announcement in perspective.</li><li>The Exchange recognises that there may be some instances where an issuer is prevented from disclosing the financial impact with certainty. One example may be the existence of certain variables that are outside the issuer's control, such as fulfillment of a contract on an ad-hoc basis or poor visibility as to when revenue is generated. Under these circumstances, the issuer should provide an explanation for the non-disclosure and sufficient information to enable investors to independently assess the financial impact taking into consideration the variables disclosed.</li><li>The inclusion of generic or boilerplate statements is of limited use to investors. For example, vague statements such as “the issuer expects to remain profitable” or imprecise terms such as “double digit performance” do not provide useful information to investors as to the possible scale of performance expected. As another example, if a transaction will only be conducted in the next financial year, a statement merely stating that the transaction is not expected to have a material impact for the current financial year will not be meaningful. In this regard, issuers should set out the specific facts or circumstances that has affected or may affect performance, and provide insightful analysis on the impact for investors to make an informed assessment of the issuer's prospects.</li></ol></li><li><div>Other issues<br>&nbsp;</div><blockquote><p><em><span class="me">Information from third parties</span></em></p></blockquote><ol><li>Announcements by third parties, such as industry regulators, may be considered material information. If the issuer assesses that there is material impact from these developments, it should make the necessary disclosure, with an assessment impact of the event.</li><li>There may be instances where a third party releases information on behalf of, or relevant to, an issuer, for example in the case of a takeover. Where possible, issuers should ensure that the announcement provided by the third parties is made under the issuer's name, so that investors can locate all announcements relating to an issuer when they access SGXNET. Third parties and professional advisers who do not represent the issuer are also encouraged to liaise with the issuer and make necessary arrangements to release any material announcement pertaining to the issuer under the issuer's name.<br><br><em><span class="me">Publication on the issuer's website</span></em></li><li>The Exchange does not prohibit issuers from disseminating information through other media such as the Internet. Issuers are reminded that any material information released on the Internet, including posting of information on its own website, should have been previously released via SGXNET, or should be simultaneously released via SGXNET.<br><br><em><span class="me">Analyst briefings</span></em></li><li>The Exchange does not prohibit issuers from conducting briefings with analysts and holding meetings with groups of investors and the media. However, such meetings might create a perception that analysts, institutional investors, fund managers or media have access to information that is not generally available to the public and this may undermine investors' confidence in the existence of a level playing field. Hence, an issuer should have in place policies to minimise the risk of being perceived to be practising selective disclosure. Such policies might include pre-release of any prepared information intended for the briefings and meetings, for example slides or speeches, via SGXNET. Alternatively, as such information must not be material, non-public information, it could be released on the issuer's website with an accompanying SGXNET announcement to inform investors that additional information is available on the issuer's website. The second alternative may be preferred if the issuer intends to release large-sized files or provide a webcast of the briefing.</li><li>Where an issuer inadvertently discloses material, non-public information during these briefings or meetings, the issuer must disseminate the information via SGXNET as promptly as possible. An issuer may, if necessary, request a trading halt in its securities.<br><br><em><span class="me">Response to queries from the Exchange</span></em></li><li>The Exchange may suspend the trading of an issuer's securities if an issuer fails to respond to a query issued by the Exchange before the commencement of trading or where there is unusual market activity upon commencement of trading. The issuance of a holding announcement by the issuer stating that the Exchange is querying the issuer is not acceptable, as the investing public would still be trading on an uninformed basis. Issuers may request a trading halt to facilitate the release of announcements.</li></ol></li></ol></div><p class="rulebook-amended"><em>Amended on </em><a class="alias-file-path" href="/net_file_store/SGX_Mainboard_rules_2011_amended2.pdf" target="_blank"><em>29 September 2011</em></a><a class="raw-file-path" href="/sites/default/files/net_file_store/SGX_Mainboard_rules_September_29_2011_amended2.pdf" target="_blank"><em>29 September 2011</em></a><em>, </em><a class="alias-file-path" href="/net_file_store/SGX_Mainboard_Rules_February_7_2020_ii.pdf" target="_blank"><em>7 February 2020</em></a><a class="raw-file-path" href="/sites/default/files/net_file_store/SGX_Mainboard_Rules_February_7_2020_ii.pdf" target="_blank"><em>7 February 2020</em></a><em> and </em><a href="/sites/default/files/net_file_store/AMENDMENTS_TO_ENFORCEMENT_(MAINBOARD)_1_August_2021.pdf" target="_blank"><em>1 August 2021</em></a><em>.</em></p>

Introduction</strong></p><div class="list">  1.1 This Practice Note provides information on the role of <span class="me">the surveillance function</span> ("Surveillance") and the procedures normally employed when an issuer is queried regarding trading in its securities.</div><p>  <strong>2. Unusual Trading Activity</strong></p><div class="list">  2.1 As set out under Paragraph 18 of <a href="/node/5372">Appendix 7.1</a>, unusual trading activity in an issuer's securities, without it being apparent that publicly available information could account for the activity, may signify trading by persons who are acting on unannounced material information or on a rumour or report, whether true or false.</div><div class="list">  2.2 The unusual market activity may not be traceable directly to unannounced information or to a rumour or report. Nevertheless, the market activity itself may be misleading to investors, who may assume that a sudden and appreciable change in the price of, or volume traded in, the issuer's securities reflects a corresponding change in its business or prospects.</div><p>  <strong>3. Role of Surveillance</strong></p><div class="list">  3.1 Surveillance utilizes a real-time market surveillance system which employs the latest technology to automatically alert the Surveillance officers to market behaviour such as unusual price and volume movements of an issuer's securities. The Surveillance officer then examines whether public information, company specific news, counter-specific trends, industry trends, economic factors or prevailing market sentiment, can explain the market activity. If no explanation is apparent, the Exchange requires the issuer to inform the public whether it is aware of any material information that might reasonably be expected to have a significant effect on the trading volume or price of its securities.</div><div class="list">  3.2 Surveillance will issue a query, depending on the extent of the unusual trading activity, measured against pre-determined thresholds set by the Exchange from time to time.</div><div class="list">  3.3 Query by Surveillance  <div class="list">    3.3.1 All queries will be posted on SGXNET by the Exchange immediately. The Surveillance officer will make every effort to contact the issuer's authorized representatives to alert the issuer to the Exchange's query.  </div>  <div class="list">    3.3.2 The query will be emailed to the issuer.  </div></div><p>  <strong>4. Response on Receiving a Query on Unusual Trading Activity</strong></p><div class="list">  4.1 An issuer is expected to respond to a query as soon as possible. Issuers should, therefore, ensure that they are operationally ready to respond promptly. In view of the importance of maintaining a fair and efficient market, issuers must, upon receiving a query from the Exchange, immediately undertake an enquiry to ascertain the cause of the unusual trading activity. Issuers should have in place, procedures to ensure that the enquiry or information gathering is carried out efficiently, systematically and promptly, so that the issuer is able to disseminate all material information as soon as possible.</div><div class="list">  4.2 Paragraph 20 of <a href="/node/5372">Appendix 7.1</a> sets out some possible causes for unusual trading and how issuers should respond to the queries based on different causes.</div><div class="list">  4.3 An issuer may wish to, where appropriate, request for suspension of trading in its securities or a trading halt. If so, the issuer should contact Securities Market Control and provide a SGXNET announcement requesting for suspension or a trading halt, stating the reason for the suspension or trading halt. Where possible, it would be useful for issuers to inform investors when the issuer can respond to the Exchange's query and when the suspension of its securities or trading halt is expected to be lifted.</div><div class="list">  4.4 The person providing the reply to the Exchange must be authorised by the Board to do so. The directors of the issuer must collectively and individually take responsibility for the accuracy of the replies provided to the Exchange with regards to the query raised by Surveillance.</div><p>  <strong>5. Secondary Listings and Issuers that are Exempted from Continuing Listing Obligations</strong></p><div class="list">  5.1 Issuers with a secondary listing on the Exchange and issuers that are exempted from the continuing listing obligations under <a href="/node/5062">Chapter 7</a> must comply with the home exchanges' disclosure requirements. Nevertheless, as the securities of such issuers are being traded on the Exchange, the Exchange must ensure that there is a fair and orderly market in these securities. Issuers may therefore be required to respond to queries regarding the trading of their securities on the Exchange.</div><p>  <strong>6. Keeping Track of Persons with Access to Material Information</strong></p><div class="list">  6.1 Paragraph 12 of <a href="/node/5372">Appendix 7.1</a> explains that material information, which is otherwise required to be disclosed under <a href="/node/5068">Rule 703</a>(1), may be temporarily withheld under <a href="/node/5068">Rule 703</a>(3), provided that the strictest confidentiality is maintained.</div><div class="list">  6.2 To ensure the confidentiality of the information and as a matter of good corporate governance, where an issuer relies on <a href="/node/5068">Rule 703</a>(3) to withhold material information, the issuer must be able to keep track of persons who gained access to the information. These persons may include internal staff or external advisers. The issuer's supervision aids in the control of information flow, as well as assists in investigations in case of information "leaks".</div><div class="list">  6.3 Unusual trading activity observed in an issuer's securities could indicate possible "leaks" of material information. In this circumstance, the Exchange may request the issuer to submit a list of persons who have access to the information ("privy persons list"). The privy persons list should typically include information on the identity of the privy persons, the circumstances under which these persons gained access to the information (i.e. became aware or involved in the transaction), and the dates on which these persons first gained access to the information. The Exchange may also ask for related information reasonably required for the proper discharge of its regulatory function.</div><div class="list">  6.4 The issuer must have proper procedures in place to provide the privy persons list expeditiously to the Exchange upon request.

Introduction</strong></p><div class="list">  1.1. This practice note sets out how the listing rules on disclosure work when a company receives an offer for listed shares. It is issued to provide guidance on the continuing listing obligations of listed issuers in the event that they are informed of a proposed offer for their shares or are made an offer for listed shares held by them. The circumstances used to illustrate the principles are drawn from past cases.</div><p>  <strong>2. The facts</strong></p><div class="list">  2.1. A Potential Purchaser made an unconditional offer by letter to Company A to acquire Company B's shares held by Company A. Both Company A and Company B are listed on SGX-ST. If the offer was accepted, the Potential Purchaser would be required under The Singapore Code of Takeovers and Mergers ("Code") to make a mandatory offer for all the shares in Company B that were not held by it.</div><div class="list">  2.2. Company A and Company B received the offer letter shortly before 2 pm.</div><div class="list">  2.3. At 4.30 pm, Company B requested a trading halt pending an announcement.</div><div class="list">  2.4. At 7.30 pm, Company A announced that it had received the offer.</div><div class="list">  2.5. At 8.45 pm, Company B made an announcement attaching Company A's announcement.</div><p>  <strong>3. The Issue</strong></p><div class="list">  3.1. <a href="/node/5068">Listing Rule 703</a>(1) states that an issuer must make immediate announcement of any information known to the issuer concerning it or any of its subsidiaries or associated companies which:  <div class="list">    (a) is necessary to avoid the establishment of a false market in the issuer's securities, or  </div>  <div class="list">    (b) would be likely to materially affect the price or value of its securities.  </div></div><div class="list">  3.2. Should either company have:  <div class="list">    (a) asked for a trading halt immediately on receipt of the offer letter, or  </div>  <div class="list">    (b) made an immediate announcement of receipt of the offer letter?  </div></div><p>  <strong>4. Company A's Position</strong></p><div class="list">  4.1. The company secretary received the offer letter when he was at a board meeting, and alerted the chairman when the meeting ended at 2.25pm. The company secretary proceeded to attend a scheduled meeting which commenced immediately. The chairman was not present in the latter meeting. At around 3pm, the company secretary discussed with the chairman whether a trading halt should be called. They concluded that the offer was not material in relation to Company A and as such, did not warrant disclosure during trading hours and correspondingly a trading halt. The chairman convened a board meeting. At 4pm, the board together with Company A's legal and financial advisers, met to discuss, among other issues relating to the offer, whether a trading halt should be called. In the meantime, Company A monitored its shares for signs of unusual trading activity.</div><div class="list">  4.2. The Company A board agreed that it was not necessary to call for a trading halt of Company A's shares.</div><div class="list">  4.3. Company A took the view that, as there was no material information which needed to be disclosed during trading hours and confidentiality was maintained, no immediate disclosure and accordingly no trading halt, was necessary.</div><div class="list">  4.4 Further, Company A felt that even if the offer was material information, the conditions for exemption from disclosure in <a href="/node/5068">Listing Rule 703</a>(3), as set out below, were met  <div class="list">    (a) Condition 1: This condition states that a reasonable person would not expect the information to be disclosed. Company A was of the view that a reasonable person would not expect the information to be disclosed. Premature disclosure could prejudice its ability to proceed in the best possible way.  </div>  <div class="list">    (b) Condition 2: This condition states that the information is confidential. Company A took that view that the information on the offer was confidential.  </div>  <div class="list">    (c) Condition 3: This condition requires one or more of the following to be applicable:&#8212;    <div class="list">      (i) the information concerns an incomplete proposal or negotiation;    </div>    <div class="list">      (ii) the information comprises matters of supposition or is insufficiently definite to warrant disclosure;    </div>    <div class="list">      (iii) the information is generated for the internal management purposes of the entity;    </div>    <div class="list">      (iv) the information is a trade secret.    </div>    <div class="noindent">      Company A opined that the information concerned an incomplete proposal or negotiation. The offer was unsolicited and the board might wish to negotiate.    </div>  </div></div><div class="list">  4.5. Company A also explained that it made an announcement on the offer at 7.30 pm as:  <div class="list">    (a) under the Code, all announcements of takeover offers had to be accompanied by a directors' responsibility statement. This was prepared after the board meeting concluded at about 4.45 pm.  </div>  <div class="list">    (b) based on market practice, announcements are released at the earliest "natural" trading break so as not to disrupt trading.  </div>  <div class="list">    (c) Company A's shares were trading "cum-offer" in respect of another then on-going offer with the last day for trading "cum-offer" being the next day.  </div></div><p>  <strong>5. Company B's Position</strong></p><div class="list">  5.1. The offer letter was addressed to Company A and copied to Company B's chairman and company secretary.</div><div class="list">  5.2. At 2.35 pm, Company B's company secretary tried unsuccessfully to contact Company A's company secretary. In the meantime, Company B monitored its shares for signs of unusual trading activity. At around 4.30 pm, Company B's chief executive officer received a call from Company A's company secretary, advising him to call for a trading halt. Company B immediately contacted SGX to request a trading halt.</div><div class="list">  5.3. Company B took the view that, as the target of a potential takeover offer, it had to comply with the Code. Rule 2 of the Code requires absolute secrecy before an announcement is made of a takeover offer or a potential takeover offer.</div><div class="list">  5.4. In making its decision, Company B drew a distinction between information involving the issuer as an active participant and as a passive participant. As the offer was made to Company A, whose decision would determine whether there would be a mandatory offer for Company B's shares, Company B needed to establish the facts with Company A before deciding its course of action.</div><p>  <strong>6. Disclosure Obligations Under Listing Rule 703</strong></p><div class="list">  6.1. <a href="/node/5068">Listing Rule 703</a>(1) states that an issuer must make immediate announcement of any information known to the issuer concerning it or any of its subsidiaries or associated companies which:  <div class="list">    (a) is necessary to avoid the establishment of a false market in the issuer's securities; or  </div>  <div class="list">    (b) would be likely to materially affect the price or value of its securities.  </div></div><div class="list">  6.2. Paragraph 2 of <a href="/node/5544">Practice Note 7.1</a> states that, apart from quantitative factors, an issuer should consider qualitative and circumstantial factors when deciding whether it must disclose information under <a href="/node/5068">Listing Rule 703</a>(1).</div><div class="list">  6.3 In a negotiation, both the potential purchaser and the potential seller have the right not to proceed with the deal. However, by extending the unconditional offer to Company A, the Potential Purchaser had locked itself into making a takeover offer for Company B's shares should Company A decide to accept the offer for its holding of Company B shares. Thus, the offer to Company A was firm, not an incomplete proposal or negotiation. Nevertheless, Company A might have wanted to initiate negotiation for a higher price. In which case, should there be any suspicion that information about the offer was no longer confidential or if in doubt, an immediate announcement should be made.</div><div class="list">  6.4. The share price of Company B moved significantly in market trading after the break for lunch, suggesting a leak of information on the offer, rendering the offer no longer confidential. Company A wondered if other factors might have accounted for the price rise, as there was upward movement in the Straits Times Index ("STI") that day. However, if it could not be reasonably determined that the upward movement in the STI was the only cause of the price increase, Company A should have erred on the side of caution and considered the information as no longer confidential. Further, in assessing the materiality of a transaction, its size and strategic significance should be taken into consideration The offer concerned the sale of an asset of some strategic significance worth more than $500 million.</div><div class="list">  6.5. What might Company A have done? Company A should have given immediate attention to the matter. Company A received notification of the offer before 2pm but the first discussion, between the chairman and the company secretary, took place only at around 3 pm. This was followed by a meeting of the Company A board at 4pm and a decision was only reached after 4pm, more than 2 hours after receipt of the offer letter. The listing rule requires a company to make immediate disclosure, which means that consideration of the matter must be a priority.</div><div class="list">  6.6 Further, it is important to note that a trading halt may be requested up to 3 days ahead of the release of information. The procedure was designed to help companies meet their listing rule obligations. Therefore:  <div class="list">    (a) while material announcements may be withheld until after trading ends where the information is contained to the company, it should not be withheld until after trading ends as a matter of course and definitely not when there are other parties in possession of it, and  </div>  <div class="list">    (b) if an issuer should, but is not able to, announce material information immediately, a trading halt should be called to ensure that trading will only take place in an informed market.  </div></div><div class="list">  6.7. If Company A was not yet in a position to decide on the issues that the offer letter posed -materiality, confidentiality and its response to the offer, it might have requested a trading halt until such time it had considered the matter. Equally it might have considered a holding or clarificatory announcement.</div><div class="list">  6.8. What might Company B have done? Company B had an obligation under <a href="/node/5068">Listing Rule 703</a>(1) to make an immediate announcement. The offer was material information to Company B. If Company B had to establish facts with Company A before deciding its course of action, it should have been insistent on doing so immediately. In the meantime, Company B might have called for a trading halt in its shares until such time it was able to establish the facts with Company A and release an announcement on the offer. If possible, as discussed below, any such trading halt should be co-ordinated with other listed entities.</div><div class="list">  6.9 Rule 2 of the Code requires secrecy before any announcement of a takeover offer or possible takeover offer. This is to minimize the risk of a leakage of information to selected parties. The Rule, however, does not prevent any party to the takeover offer from making an announcement of the takeover offer. In fact, Rule 3.4 of the Code states that a potential offeror should not attempt to prevent the board of an offeree company from making an announcement or requesting the Securities Exchange to grant a trading halt at any time the offeree board considers appropriate. This clearly indicates that Company B is not prohibited from making an announcement of the offer under the Code.</div><p>  <strong>7. Potential Purchaser's Position</strong></p><div class="list">  7.1. Under Rule 3.1 of the Code, before the board of an offeree is approached, the responsibility for making an announcement normally rests with the offeror, who should keep a close watch on the offeree's share price and volume. If there is undue movement in the offeree's share price or volume, and there are reasonable grounds for concluding that the offeror's actions (whether through inadequate security, purchase of the offeree's shares or otherwise) have directly contributed to the situation, the offeror must make an announcement. This rule suggests that the only party who should be aware of an offeror's intentions is the offeror itself.</div><div class="list">  7.2. In this case, the Potential Purchaser had informed Company B of the offer. Such action is not in conflict with the Code or the listing requirements. In the case where the Potential Purchaser had not forwarded the letter to Company B, the Potential Purchaser would then have had to keep a close watch on the offeree's share price and volume. Should there have been any significant unusual movement in the price or trading volume of Company B's shares, with reasonable grounds to attribute the movement directly to the offer made to Company A, the Potential Purchaser would have had to immediately inform Company B and Company A to request a trading halt, followed by an announcement of its offer to Company A.</div><p>  <strong>8. General Principle</strong></p><div class="list">  8.1. In a takeover it is important that the market is given material information in a timely and coordinated way. This condition is easily met when an offer is made after market hours. However if it is necessary to make the offer during market hours, suspension or trading halts should be coordinated among the listed participants.</div><div class="list">  8.2. The Exchange's disclosure rules and the Code's requirements are not in conflict. If an offeror or offeree has any doubt on how it should comply with the relevant requirements, it should consult SGX or SIC or both.</div><p>  <em>Amended on <a href="/net_file_store/SGX_Mainboard_rules_2011_amended2.pdf" target="_blank" class="alias-file-path">29 September 2011</a><a href="/sites/default/files/net_file_store/SGX_Mainboard_rules_September_29_2011_amended2.pdf" target="_blank" class="raw-file-path">29 September 2011</a>.</em></p>

Introduction</strong></p><div class="list">  1.1 This Practice Note publishes the guide provided by the Council on Corporate Disclosure and Governance on the Operating and Financial Review in an annual report.</div><div class="list">  1.2 Issuers are encouraged to follow the OFR Guide, but it is not compulsory.</div><p>  <strong>2. OFR Guide</strong></p><div class="list">  2.1 The OFR Guide is enclosed.</div><p>  <strong>Guide for Operating and Financial Review</strong></p><p>  <strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p><div class="list">  1. The objective of the Operating and Financial Review ("OFR") in annual reports is to provide users with an understanding of the company by providing an analysis of the company's businesses as seen through the eyes of the directors and management. The OFR serves to facilitate assessment of the company's business and business objectives, its principal drivers of performance, the dynamics of the business, and the performance and financial condition of the company.</div><div class="list">  2. Companies listed on the Singapore Exchange ("SGX") are currently required to include a discussion of their operating and financial performance and business outlook under the SGX listing rules<sup>1</sup>. This Guide provides a set of best practice guidance to listed companies in the preparation of the OFR in their annual reports, which will complement and supplement the financial statements.</div><div class="list">  3. The approach taken in this Guide is to set out general guidance, in the form of <strong><em>Principles</em></strong> and <strong><em>Guidelines</em></strong><em>,</em> on the OFR, rather than to prescribe a set of mandatory rules or requirements. Adherence with the Guide is voluntary. The <strong><em>Principles</em></strong> set out in the Guide should be regarded as fundamental to the preparation of a good OFR. The <strong><em>Guidelines</em></strong> elaborate on how those principles can be applied.</div><div class="list">  4. Listed companies are encouraged to apply these best practices for disclosure of information in their OFRs. It is recognised that not all items in the guidelines may be relevant to all companies, as companies vary by size, industry group and other factors. The guidance should also not be regarded as a comprehensive list of the matters that might be considered by the directors and management to be relevant to an assessment of the company. The OFR should focus on those matters that are considered significant to that company as a whole. It is for the directors and management to decide how best to apply the framework of this Guide to the particular circumstances of the company.</div><p>  <strong>OBJECTIVES AND TENETS OF THE OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW</strong></p><div class="list">  1. The objective of the OFR is to provide users with a good understanding of the company by providing a historical and prospective analysis of the company's businesses as seen through the eyes of the directors and management. The OFR should assist the user's assessment of its performance and understanding of the future direction of the company. The OFR should focus on matters of significance to the company as a whole.</div><div class="list">  2. The focus of the OFR is on explanations and analysis. It should contain analytical description, rather than replicate information in the financial statements. It should discuss and interpret the performance and financial condition of the company, in the context of opportunities and risks impacting the operations of the company and known or reasonably expected changes in the environment in which it operates. The OFR should discuss known trends and factors relevant to forming a view as to likely future performance. An explanation of the trends and uncertainties known to be facing the company would not require a forecast of the outcome of such uncertainties. Rather, the explanation should be sufficient to permit readers of the financial report to form their own judgements of the outcomes of such uncertainties.</div><div class="list">  3. The benefits of particular disclosures should be balanced against any potential commercial risks to the company from the disclosure of commercially sensitive information. This Guide does not expect that disclosure be made by listed companies of information of a commercially prejudicial or sensitive nature that a reasonable person would not expect to be disclosed, for example where:&#8212;  <div class="list">    (a) the information concerns a trade secret;  </div>  <div class="list">    (b) the information concerns an incomplete proposal or negotiation; or  </div>  <div class="list">    (c) information comprises matters of supposition and is insufficiently definite to warrant disclosure.  </div></div><div class="list">  4 Information and analysis contained in the OFR should, as far as possible, be neutral and free from bias, dealing even-handedly with both good and bad aspects. The directors and management should ensure that material information is not omitted. Where the information in the OFR relates to financial information, it should be consistent with information in the audited financial statements. This should not be taken to mean that an audit of the OFR is required.</div><p>  <strong>PRINCIPLES AND GUIDELINES</strong></p><div class="list">  <strong>(A) Presentation of the OFR<br />  <br />  Principle 1</strong>  <div class="list">    1 The OFR should focus on matters that are relevant to investors. It should be easy for users of financial reports to understand.<br />    <br />    Guidelines    <div class="list">      1.1 The OFR should be written in a style that is clear and readily understood. It should avoid the use of technical language as far as possible. Figures and graphics may be useful to assist understanding of discussions in the OFR.    </div>    <div class="list">      1.2 To facilitate reference to OFR disclosures by users of the annual report, it could be useful to include the key discussions of the OFR in a distinct, stand-alone section of the annual report. However, companies may decide that, in the context of the format of their annual report, it would be preferable to incorporate some of the discussion within other sections of the annual report, such as the Chairman's statement or the Chief Executive Officer's statement.    </div>    <div class="list">      1.3 While the approach adopted for the presentation of the OFR may evolve over time, or differ from that adopted by other companies, disclosure should be sufficient for the user to be able to compare the information presented in the OFR of the company with that in previous periods, and with information about other companies in the same industry or sectors, where practical.    </div>  </div></div><div class="list">  <strong>(B) Company Overview, Objectives and Strategy<br />  <br />  Principle 2</strong>  <div class="list">    2 The OFR should describe the nature of the company, its objectives and broad strategies, and explain the main areas of operation of the company's business, as context for the discussion and analysis of performance and financial position. The discussion in the OFR should cover the group business of the listed company, including its principal subsidiaries.<br />    <br />    Guidelines    <div class="list">      2.1 The OFR should discuss the objectives for the business and broadly, management's strategy for achieving them. Objectives may be defined in terms of financial performance. Non-financial objectives may also be discussed, where relevant.    </div>    <div class="list">      2.2 Depending on the nature of the business, discussion of the company's business and operations might cover areas such as:&#8212;      <div class="list">        &#8226;&#160;&#160; the industries, locations and markets in which the company operates;      </div>      <div class="list">        &#8226;&#160;&#160; its main products and services, business processes and distribution methods, and intellectual property;      </div>      <div class="list">        &#8226;&#160;&#160; the structure of the company and main operating facilities; and      </div>      <div class="list">        &#8226;&#160;&#160; any significant changes to the legal, social, political and regulatory environments that influence the company.      </div>    </div>  </div>  <div class="noindent">    <strong>Principle 3</strong>    <div class="list">      3 The key financial and non-financial performance indicators used by management to assess the company and its performance should be discussed.<br />      <br />      Guidelines      <div class="list">        3.1 The OFR would normally include a range of financial and non-financial measures used to measure the company's performance. Comparability would be enhanced if the measures disclosed are accepted and widely used within the industry sector or more generally. Where practical, performance indicators should be compared with previous periods to outline trends.      </div>      <div class="list">        3.2 The measures used should be defined, and the basis for calculation explained. Comparative amounts should be disclosed. Material changes in the financial measures disclosed, including significant changes in the underlying accounting policies applied, should be identified and explained. Comparative amounts should be restated on the new basis, where practical.      </div>    </div>  </div></div><div class="list">  <strong>(C) Operating Review<br />  <br />  Principle 4</strong>  <div class="list">    4 The OFR should discuss the significant features of performance for the period covered by the financial report, focusing on the overall company as well as those business or geographic segments that are relevant to an understanding of the performance as a whole.<br />    <br />    Guidelines    <div class="list">      4.1 The OFR should identify and explain the main factors that affect the activities and performance of the company, and in particular discuss those that either have varied in the past or are expected to change in the future. Discussion of past performance should be supplemented by known trends and factors that are likely to affect future performance.    </div>    <div class="list">      4.2 Key components of the result of operations should be discussed, including major sources of revenues, where appropriate. The OFR should also discuss any significant changes in capital employed. The OFR should discuss the results in comparison with prior periods and any projections publicly disclosed by the company.    </div>    <div class="list">      4.3 The OFR should set out the analysis of any significant effect on performance of changes in the industry or the environment in which the company operates and of developments within the company, for example:&#8212;      <div class="list">        &#8226;&#160;&#160; changes in market conditions;      </div>      <div class="list">        &#8226;&#160;&#160; the introduction or announcement of new products and services;      </div>      <div class="list">        &#8226;&#160;&#160; new activities, discontinued activities and other acquisitions and disposals;      </div>      <div class="list">        &#8226;&#160;&#160; asset impairments; and      </div>      <div class="list">        &#8226;&#160;&#160; results of any material acquisition, and extent to which published expectations at the time of acquisition have been realised.      </div>    </div>    <div class="list">      4.4 The analysis should cover any other special factors that have affected performance in the period under review, even where the effect cannot be quantified. Where unusual or infrequent events or transactions have affected the result for a period, the OFR should discuss their nature and impact on the company. The discussion should comment on the impact on future operations of significant post-balance sheet events.

Introduction</strong></span></p><div class="list"><span class="me">1.1 This Practice Note provides guidance on the conduct of general meetings for issuers primary-listed on the Exchange (including an issuer that is a REIT or business trust).</span></div><p><span class="me"><strong>2. Location and format of general meeting</strong></span></p><div class="list"><span class="me">2.1 Unless prohibited by relevant laws and regulations in the jurisdiction of its incorporation, an issuer primary-listed on the Exchange shall hold its general meeting either:</span><div class="list">(a) at a physical place in Singapore; or</div><div class="list">(b) at a physical place in Singapore and using technology that allows a person to participate in a meeting without being physically present at the place of meeting (“virtual meeting technology”).</div></div><div class="list"><span class="me">2.2 General meetings are important avenues for shareholders to voice their opinion and seek clarifications from the Board and management on matters relating to an issuer. At these meetings, shareholders are given the opportunity to meet with the management team, the external auditors and key members of the Board, such as the Chairman, the Audit Committee Chairman and the independent directors. This enhances the quality of communication between the issuer and its shareholders.</span></div><div class="list">2.3 Shareholders have the right to participate fully in general meetings, regardless of the format of the meeting. These rights include the right to attend, ask questions, communicate their views, and to appoint proxies or to vote at general meetings. In deciding on the format of the general meeting, issuers should have regard to the size and needs of their shareholder base and how best to facilitate shareholder engagement. For the purpose of this Practice Note, references to “shareholders” include references to duly appointed proxies.</div><div class="list"><span class="me">2.4 Issuers may be required by the laws and regulations of their country of incorporation to hold general meetings within their jurisdictions and in accordance with their constitutions. Such issuers will be required to demonstrate to the Exchange the restrictions in their jurisdictions that prohibit general meetings from being held at a physical place outside their country of incorporation. They must nonetheless allow shareholders in Singapore to participate using virtual meeting technology, unless the issuers demonstrate to the Exchange the restrictions in their jurisdictions or constitutions that prohibit such shareholders from participating using virtual meeting technology.</span></div><div class="list"><span class="me">2.5 Issuers who hold general meetings outside Singapore without allowing shareholders in Singapore to participate using virtual meeting technology should hold information meetings for the shareholders at a physical place in Singapore. These provide an avenue for the shareholders in Singapore to interact directly with the Board and management of the issuers as they would at the general meetings.</span></div><div class="list"><span class="me">2.6 The Exchange recognises that there could be other circumstances which call for an issuer to hold its general meetings outside Singapore, such as to reach a larger public shareholder base, if most of its shareholders are based outside Singapore. The Exchange is prepared to consider these circumstances on a case-by-case basis. Issuers should consult the Exchange on the applicability of Listing <a href="/node/6222">Rule 730A</a>(1) in the event of any doubt.</span></div><div class="list"><span class="me">2.7 An issuer is required to disclose the circumstances under which its general meetings are convened outside Singapore in the following:—</span><div class="list"><span class="me">(a) listing applicant's IPO prospectus, introductory document or offering circular or memorandum if the arrangement to hold the general meetings outside Singapore is known at the time of listing; and</span></div><div class="list"><span class="me">(b) SGXNET announcement when the arrangement to hold the general meetings outside Singapore is approved by the Exchange after listing.</span></div></div><div class="list">2.8 General meetings held at a physical place and using virtual meeting technology must in respect of shareholders participating using virtual meeting technology:<div class="list">(a) have processes for the share registrar to verify and authenticate the identities of shareholders attending meetings using virtual meeting technology;</div><div class="list">(b) provide real-time remote electronic voting;</div><div class="list">(c) provide real-time electronic communication to enable shareholders to follow the proceedings and enable questions to be raised and answered; and</div><div class="list">(d) be at no cost to shareholders.</div></div><p><strong><span class="me">3. Notice of meeting and dissemination of documents</span></strong></p><div class="list">3.1 All notices of general meeting of issuers and documents relating to the business of the general meeting must be disseminated in accordance with <a href="/node/5323">Chapter 12</a> of the Listing Rules.</div><div class="list">3.2 All notices convening general meetings must be sent to shareholders at least 14 calendar days (or 21 calendar days, where special resolutions are proposed) before the meeting. In each case, the notice period excludes the date of the notice and the date of the meeting. Issuers are strongly encouraged to provide at least 21 calendar days’ notice to shareholders.</div><div class="list">3.3 All notices of general meetings (including notices for adjourned or postponed meetings) must contain the following:<div class="list">(a) the date and time of commencement of the meeting;</div><div class="list">(b) the resolutions to be proposed;</div><div class="list">(c) details on the physical place of the meeting;</div><div class="list">(d) if a meeting is held at a physical place and using virtual meeting technology, the arrangements for shareholders to participate in the meeting using virtual meeting technology and how real-time remote electronic voting and real-time electronic communication will be conducted; and</div><div class="list">(e) instructions to shareholders on how they may:<div class="list">(i) access any documents or information relating to the business of the meeting;</div><div class="list">(ii) submit their questions ahead of the meeting (e.g. via email) or raise questions at the meeting (e.g. via videoconferencing), the timeframe for submission of questions in advance and how the substantial and relevant questions will be responded to prior to, or at, the meeting; and</div><div class="list">(iii) cast their votes, including specific instructions to CPF and SRS investors, if applicable.</div></div></div><p><strong><span class="me">4. Written questions</span></strong></p><div class="list">4.1 As a general principle, shareholders must be given the opportunity to ask written questions within a reasonable time prior to general meetings.</div><div class="list">4.2 As a guideline, after the publication of the notice of general meeting, shareholders should be allowed at least 7 calendar days to submit their written questions. This is to accord shareholders with reasonable time to consider the matters to be tabled at the general meeting and submit their written questions.</div><div class="list">4.3 Issuers should encourage shareholders to submit their written questions promptly for these to be addressed. Shareholders should be informed of any cut-off time within which written questions must be submitted and when their written questions would be responded to. If written questions or follow-up written questions are submitted after the cut-off time, issuers should also seek to respond to these questions within a reasonable timeframe.</div><div class="list">4.4 Issuers may respond to written questions prior to the general meeting through publication on SGXNET and, if available, the issuer’s corporate website. Alternatively, issuers may respond to written questions at the general meeting. Issuers are strongly encouraged, as far as possible, to respond to substantial and relevant comments or queries promptly, and at least 48 hours prior to the closing date and time for the lodgment of proxy forms, to facilitate shareholders’ votes. The Board or management must respond to all substantial and relevant comments or queries.</div><p><strong><span class="me">5. Voting</span></strong></p><div class="list"><span class="me">5.1 An issuer should encourage its shareholders to vote at its general meetings in person. If shareholders are unable to vote in person, they should be allowed to appoint proxies to represent them.</span></div><div class="list">5.2 Issuers may allow real-time remote electronic voting through an electronic voting system to take place at the general meeting, such that shareholders may vote remotely by electronic means. The issuer must ensure that it has implemented the necessary safeguards to validate votes submitted by shareholders, including the following:<div class="list">(a) the electronic voting system that is used accurately counts all votes cast at the meeting;</div><div class="list">(b) the electronic voting system that is used is capable of providing an audit trail of records on the operation of the electronic voting system, including the accuracy of the recording and counting of votes;</div><div class="list">(c) each vote that is cast is verified by the issuer as cast by shareholders entitled to vote; and</div><div class="list">(d) the chairman of the meeting must, during the meeting, declare the result of any matter put to a vote at the meeting.</div></div><div class="list"><span class="me">5.3 Proxy forms must be designed clearly to allow a shareholder appointing a proxy to indicate how the shareholder would like the proxy to vote in relation to each resolution. Shareholders may choose to appoint the chairman of the meeting as his or her proxy.</span></div><div class="list"><span class="me">5.4 If a shareholder submits a proxy form and subsequently attends the meeting in person and votes, the appointment of the proxy should be revoked. There must be sufficient systems or processes in place at the meeting to identify and cancel the appointment of the proxy at the point when the shareholder attends the meeting.</span></div><p><strong><span class="me">6. Minutes</span></strong></p><div class="list">6.1 Issuers must publish minutes within one month after the general meeting on SGXNET and, if available, the issuer’s corporate website.</div><div class="list">6.2 The minutes should record substantial and relevant comments or queries from shareholders relating to the agenda of the general meeting, and responses from the Board or management.</div><p><em>Amended on <a href="/sites/default/files/net_file_store/Mainboard_Rules_Practice_Note_General_Meetings.pdf" target="_blank">1 July 2023</a></em>.</p>

Introduction</strong></p><p class="list-item">1.1 Listing <a href="/node/6527">Rule 711A</a> requires every issuer to prepare an annual sustainability report, which must describe the issuer's sustainability practices with reference to the primary components set out in Listing <a href="/node/6528">Rule 711B</a> on a 'comply or explain' basis (other than as required under Listing <a href="/node/6528">Rule 711B</a>(2)). This Practice Note contains the Sustainability Reporting Guide (the "<strong>Guide</strong>"), which provides guidance on the expected structure and contents and the preparation of the sustainability report.</p><p class="list-item">1.2 Sustainability reporting disclosure does not detract from the issuer's obligation to disclose any information that is necessary to avoid the establishment of a false market in the issuer's securities or would be likely to materially affect the price or value of its securities pursuant to Listing <a href="/node/5068">Rule 703</a>.</p><p class="list-item">1.3 A glossary of the common terms used in the Guide is set out in paragraph 8 of this Guide.</p><p class="list-item"><strong>2. Policy Statement on Sustainability Reporting</strong></p><p class="list-item">2.1 Issuers make regular financial reports to their investors that are used for assessment of the likelihood of repayment and the returns on investment.</p><p class="list-item">2.2 The addition of sustainability reporting to financial reporting provides a more comprehensive picture of the issuer: statements of financial position and comprehensive income provide a snapshot of the present and an account of the past year, while sustainability reports of environmental, social and governance (“<strong>ESG</strong>”) factors show the risks and opportunities within sight, managed for future returns. Taken together, the combined financial and sustainability reports enable a better assessment of the issuer's financial prospects, the sustainability of the current business into the future and quality of management.</p><p class="list-item">2.3 To achieve the additional transparency which encourages efficiency and innovation, SGX-ST requires each issuer to publish an annual sustainability report. This Guide provides guidance to the issuer on compliance with the requirements under the Listing Rules.</p><p class="list-item"><strong>3. Principles</strong></p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1 list-item"><strong>Board responsibility</strong></p><p class="list-item">3.1 The Code states as its preamble that sustainability, together with accountability and transparency, is a tenet of good governance. It provides that the Board is collectively responsible for the long-term success of the issuer, and the Board's role includes setting strategic objectives which should include appropriate focus on sustainability. The Board has ultimate responsibility for the issuer's sustainability reporting. Consistent with its role, the Board should determine the ESG factors identified as material to the business and see to it that they are monitored and managed. Management has responsibility to ensure that the ESG factors are monitored on an ongoing basis and properly managed. The Board's close interaction with management will enable the Board to satisfy itself on the way sustainability governance is structured and functioning through the various levels of management. If any question is raised regarding the issuer's sustainability reporting, the Board and management should make sure it is addressed.</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1 list-item"><strong>'Comply or explain'</strong></p><p class="list-item">3.2 Each issuer is required to prepare an annual sustainability report. The sustainability report must include the primary components as set out in Listing <a href="/node/6528">Rule 711B</a> on a 'comply or explain' basis (other than as required under Listing <a href="/node/6528">Rule 711B</a>(2)). Where the issuer cannot report on any primary component, the issuer must state so and explain what it does instead and the reasons for doing so. As set out in Listing <a href="/node/6528">Rule 711B</a>(2), an issuer must not exclude the primary component in Listing <a href="/node/6528">Rule 711B</a>(1)(aa).</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1 list-item"><strong>Report risks as well as opportunities</strong></p><p class="list-item">3.3 In identifying material ESG factors, the issuer should consider both risks and opportunities. In addition, it is conceptually sound, and validated by experience, that risks well-managed represent strengths which can be applied to fulfill opportunities. The risks and opportunities within sight have direct bearing on strategies and operations and should be reported for clearer understanding of the issuer's performance, prospects and management quality. To facilitate understanding, issuers should give the whole explanation in a concise manner.</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1 list-item"><strong>Balanced reporting</strong></p><p class="list-item">3.4 In reporting on sustainability, care should be taken to give a neutral and accurate view. There may be a tendency to give more prominence to what is favourable and understate what is negative. Both situations require comprehensive explanations. In reporting performance, factors beyond the issuer's control are as relevant to exceeding the target as to a performance shortfall. In the event of underperformance, the issuer's response is also important and should be included to bring about confidence in its longer term sustainability objectives.</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1 list-item"><strong>Stakeholder engagement</strong></p><p class="list-item">3.5 The issuer's responsibility on disclosure, including annual reports and sustainability reports, is first and foremost to current and potential shareholders, i.e. the investing public. Interaction of the issuer with its other stakeholders is also of interest to investors for its relevance to sustainability across the value chain of the issuer. The views of stakeholders also contribute to inform the issuer's identification of material ESG factors. On a continuing basis, regular and sustained engagement with stakeholders provides the issuer with an up-to-date picture of its sustainability within both its business and physical environments. The material outcomes of such engagement should be included in the sustainability report.</p><p class="list-item"><strong>4. Contents of Sustainability Reporting</strong></p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1 list-item"><strong>Primary components</strong></p><p class="list-item">4.1 The sustainability report should comprise the following primary components:</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1 list-item">(a) <strong>Material ESG factors</strong>. The sustainability report should identify the material ESG factors, and describe both the reasons for and the process of selection, taking into consideration their relevance or impact to the business, strategy, financial planning, business model and key stakeholders.</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1 list-item">(b) <strong>Climate-related disclosures</strong>. The sustainability report should contain disclosures related to climate-related risks and opportunities.</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1 list-item">(c) <strong>Policies, practices and performance</strong>. The sustainability report should set out the issuer's policies, practices and performance in relation to the material ESG factors identified, providing descriptive and quantitative information on each of the identified material ESG factors for the reporting period. Performance should be described in the context of previously disclosed targets.</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1 list-item">(d) <strong>Targets</strong>. The sustainability report should set out the issuer's targets for the forthcoming year in relation to each material ESG factor identified. Targets should be considered for defined short, medium and long term horizons, and if not consistent with those used for strategic planning and financial reporting, the reasons for the inconsistency should be disclosed.</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1 list-item">(e) <strong>Sustainability reporting framework. </strong>The issuer should select a sustainability reporting framework (or frameworks) to guide its reporting and disclosure. For climate-related disclosures, the issuer should refer to paragraphs 4.7 to 4.28 of this Guide. The sustainability reporting framework(s) selected should be appropriate for and suited to its industry and business model. The issuer should state the name of the framework(s), explain its reasons for choosing the framework(s) and provide a general description of the extent of the issuer's application of the framework(s). Where the issuer is applying a portion of a particular framework, the issuer should provide a general description of the extent of the issuer's application of the framework.</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1 list-item">(f) <strong>Board statement</strong>. The sustainability report should contain a statement of the Board that it has considered sustainability issues in the issuer’s business and strategy, determined the material ESG factors and overseen the management and monitoring of the material ESG factors. In addition, the sustainability report should describe the roles of the Board and the management in the governance of sustainability issues.</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1 list-item"><strong>Identification of material ESG factors</strong></p><p class="list-item">4.2 The issuer should review its business in the context of the value chain and determine what ESG factors in relation to its interaction with its physical environment and social community and its governance, are material for the continuity of its business. The issuer is expected to report the criteria and process by which it has made its selection with reference to how these factors contribute to the creation of value for the issuer.</p><p class="list-item">4.3 In broad terms, environmental factors would include materials, energy, biodiversity, water, greenhouse gas (“<strong>GHG</strong>”) emissions, effluents and waste as well as environmental complaint mechanisms. Social factors would include health and safety, employment practices and labour rights such as collective bargaining, product responsibility, anti-corruption, supplier assessments and impact of direct and supply chain activities on local communities. The framework chosen is likely to have additional factors that the issuer would report on.</p><p class="list-item">4.4 Corruption is a factor on which many investors require reassurance, whether inducement is being offered to employees or by employees to others. Where corruption has been addressed in the Corporate Governance report, the issuer may refer to that report. If corruption is not assessed to be a material ESG factor by the issuer, where stakeholders express sufficient interest in the information, the issuer is advised to state its policy and safeguards on its website.</p><p class="list-item">4.5 Gender, skills and experience have been highlighted as diversity indicators material to business sustainability. Diversity greatly enhances the issuer's capacity for breadth of input and perspectives into decision making, risk alertness and responsiveness to change. The issuer should be aware of this trend and assess whether diversity is a material social factor in its business. It should engage stakeholders in assessing the necessity of reporting on this matter. In satisfying investors and other stakeholders, diversity should be examined through broad levels of staff and also importantly, in the Board. Where other sections of the annual report sufficiently address stakeholders’ interest in diversity, the issuer may refer to those sections.</p><p class="list-item">4.6 The issuer should consider not just its internal circle of operations but also widen that circle to include persons and processes in the value chain that contribute to the issuer's product or service. Parts of the business outsourced to third parties (for example, freight and logistics), as well as downstream processes (for example, product defect response), constitute an integral part of the issuer's business and need to be included in the sustainability report.</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1 list-item"><strong>Climate-related disclosures</strong></p><p class="list-item">4.7 Climate change threatens to disrupt businesses in a precipitous and potentially devastating manner, with consequential detrimental effects on their stakeholders and providers of capital. Conversely, it also opens up new markets for solutions that respond to the threat. Investors need to properly understand the climate-related risks and opportunities of their portfolio in order to price or value their investments.</p><p class="list-item">4.8 Securities markets promote the ready availability of decision-useful information so that it may be reflected in the price discovery process. In doing so, exchanges facilitate the allocation of capital to its most efficient use and the transfer of risks to those most willing to bear them.</p><p class="list-item">4.9 The IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards build on the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (“<strong>TCFD</strong>”). It aims to be a comprehensive global framework of sustainability-related financial disclosures to meet the needs of capital markets and to serve the demand for more consistent, comparable and verifiable information about the exposure to, and management of, sustainability-related risks and opportunities. The IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards were developed to support a global framework of investor-focused disclosures on sustainability-related financial information and have received widespread support globally, including from the G20 and the Financial Stability Board. The International Organization of Securities Commissions has also endorsed the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards in July 2023.&nbsp;</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1 list-item"><em>Structure of the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards and requirements on climate-related disclosures</em></p><p class="list-item">4.10 The core content of the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards is structured in alignment with the four pillars of the TCFD recommendations: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets. Climate-related risks are associated with both physical risks (such as those arising from weather-related events like storms, floods or heatwaves and longer-term shifts in climatic patterns like sea level rise) and transition risks (arising from efforts to transition to a lower-carbon economy and may include policy, technological and reputational risks).</p><p class="list-item">4.11 IFRS S1 sets out the general requirements for disclosure of sustainability-related financial information including the conceptual foundations, core content, general requirements and judgements, uncertainties and errors. IFRS S2 sets out supplementary requirements that relate specifically to climate-related risks and opportunities.&nbsp;</p><p class="list-item">4.12 An issuer must make the following climate-related disclosures:</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1 list-item">(a) The issuer must disclose its Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions as set out in paragraph 29(a) of IFRS S2 from its financial year

paragraph 4.12 of this Guide. In applying IFRS S1 for climate-related disclosures, an issuer should particularly refer to the objective, scope, conceptual foundations, general requirements, judgements and uncertainties and errors specified therein. Key concepts such as connected information, value chains, assessment of materiality and key requirements such as the reporting entity and timing and location of reporting are set out in IFRS S1. For example, materiality of information is judged in relation to whether omitting, misstating or obscuring the information could reasonably be expected to influence decisions of primary users of general purpose financial reports.&nbsp;</p><p class="list-item">4.14 IFRS S1 requires entities that report their sustainability-related financial disclosures in accordance with the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards to make an explicit and unreserved statement of compliance, which may not be made unless an entity complies with all the requirements, including the requirements in IFRS S1 applicable beyond climate-related disclosures. In this regard, issuers will not be required to make such a statement of compliance. The Exchange permits and encourages issuers of any size to use and fully apply the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards. An issuer that complies with all the requirements in IFRS S1 and IFRS S2 can, but is not mandated to, make an explicit and unreserved statement of compliance with the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards; an issuer that complies with all the requirements in IFRS S2 and the climate-relevant provisions in IFRS S1 can, but is not mandated to, state that it complies with the climate-related requirements in the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards.&nbsp;</p><p class="list-item">4.15 In the core content of IFRS S1, there are also specific paragraphs which may be relevant for the issuer including the elaboration of short-, medium- and long-term time horizons, trade-offs between sustainability-related risks and opportunities that an issuer considered and the objective of sustainability-related financial disclosures on risk management to enable users of general purpose financial report to assess an issuer’s overall risk profile and its overall risk management process. Issuers may avail themselves of guidance that the IFRS Foundation has published on reporting only climate-relevant provisions, as set out in paragraph 4.17 of this Guide.&nbsp;</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1 list-item"><em>ISSB guidance</em></p><p class="list-item">4.16 The ISSB has issued application guidance, which forms an integral part of the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards, on, among others, the following topics:</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1 list-item">(a) identifying sustainability-related risks and opportunities and disclosing material information about such risks and opportunities;</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1 list-item">(b) applying scenario analysis to assess climate resilience;</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1 list-item">(c) measuring GHG emissions, including Scope 3 GHG emissions;</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1 list-item">(d) disclosing information relevant to the cross-industry metric categories; and</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1 list-item">(e) disclosing information about the climate-related targets that have been set or are required to be met by law or regulation.</p><p class="list-item">4.17 In addition, the ISSB has also issued accompanying guidance containing illustrative guidance and illustrative examples to support companies in applying the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards on, among others, the following topics:</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1 list-item">(a) a guide on applying IFRS S1 when reporting only climate-related disclosures in accordance with IFRS S2, to help companies understand how to report only climate-related information using the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards;</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1 list-item">(b) a guide on GHG emissions disclosure requirements applying IFRS S2;</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1 list-item">(c) guidance on metrics that could be disclosed as part of information relevant to the cross-industry metric categories;</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1 list-item">(d) examples of disclosing GHG emissions applying the principles in IFRS S1 for aggregation and disaggregation; and</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1 list-item">(e) industry-based guidance on identifying appropriate disclosures about climate-related risks and opportunities that are associated with common business models and activities in a particular industry.</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1 list-item"><em>Reliefs</em></p><p class="list-item">4.18 The ISSB has sought to achieve a balance between the costs for companies in applying the requirements and ensuring investors are provided with consistent, comparable and verifiable information. It introduced a package of (permanent) structural reliefs and (temporary) transition reliefs in the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards.&nbsp;</p><p class="list-item">4.19 As part of the (permanent) structural reliefs, an issuer is allowed to:</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1 list-item">(a) consider its skills, capabilities and resources when determining its approach:</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-2 list-item">(i) for its climate-related scenario analysis; and</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-2 list-item">(ii) in preparing disclosures about the anticipated financial effects of a climate-related risk or opportunity; and</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1 list-item">(b) use all reasonable and supportable information that is available to the issuer at the reporting date without undue cost or effort in:</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-2 list-item">(i) identifying climate-related risks and opportunities;&nbsp;</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-2 list-item">(ii) preparing disclosures about the anticipated financial effects of a climate-related risk or opportunity;</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-2 list-item">(iii) determining its approach, and selecting the inputs, for its climate-related scenario analysis;&nbsp;</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-2 list-item">(iv) determining the scope of the value chain;</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-2 list-item">(v) calculation of amount or percentage of assets or business activities vulnerable to or aligned with climate-related risks and opportunities; and</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-2 list-item">(vi) measuring Scope 3 GHG emissions.</p><p class="list-item">4.20 As part of the (temporary) transition reliefs, an issuer (including newly-listed issuers) need not do the following in the first year of reporting applying the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards:</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1 list-item">(a) provide its Scope 3 GHG emissions;</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1 list-item">(b) use the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standards (2004) if it was previously using a different method; and</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1 list-item">(c) provide comparative information in respect of the preceding period.</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1 list-item"><em>Scope 3 GHG emissions</em></p><p class="list-item">4.21 An issuer must disclose its Scope 3 GHG emissions, if applicable, pursuant to paragraph 4.12(c) of this Guide and in accordance with IFRS S2, which requires disclosure of Scope 3 GHG emissions, and the approach used to measure such GHG emissions. Emissions must be measured in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standards (2004), subject to the reliefs specified and to the extent that it does not conflict with the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards. An issuer should consider the 15 categories of Scope 3 GHG emissions, as described in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard (2011) (“<strong>Scope 3 Standard</strong>”), to identify which categories are applicable to the issuer. The issuer might determine that not all categories are applicable to it and therefore disclose which of these categories are included in its Scope 3 GHG emissions. For example, an issuer may not have leased assets or franchises or may be unable to estimate Scope 3 GHG emissions due to a lack of data or other limiting factors, as described in the Scope 3 Standard.&nbsp;</p><p class="list-item">4.22 The ISSB has also developed a Scope 3 measurement framework to provide additional guidance about measuring Scope 3 GHG emissions. While direct measurement and primary data is preferred, an issuer may still estimate Scope 3 GHG emissions based on assumptions and appropriate inputs and use secondary data under such framework. Primary data includes data provided by suppliers or other entities in the value chain from specific activities within an entity’s value chain, while secondary data is not directly obtained. Secondary data is typically supplied by third-party providers and includes industry-average data.&nbsp;</p><p class="list-item">4.23 Issuers that are not required to report but are already reporting their Scope 3 GHG emissions are encouraged to continue to do so. Issuers that have not yet reported on Scope 3 GHG emissions are encouraged to build up their capabilities to report Scope 3 GHG emissions.</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1 list-item"><em>Scenario analysis</em></p><p class="list-item">4.24 IFRS S2 requires use of climate-related scenario analysis to inform an issuer’s disclosures about their resilience to climate change. IFRS S2 contains application guidance on how an issuer is required to determine the method of scenario analysis to assess its climate resilience. To reduce the risks and impacts of climate change, almost all countries have agreed to take action in limiting global warming to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, while pursuing efforts to arrest the increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. The issuer should describe how resilient its strategies are to climate-related risks and opportunities, taking into consideration a transition to a lower-carbon economy consistent with a 2°C or lower scenario and, where relevant, scenarios consistent with increased physical climate-related risks.</p><p class="list-item">4.25 An issuer new to scenario analysis can consider starting with qualitative scenario narratives to explore the potential range of implications. As it gains more experience, it can consider using quantitative information to describe the potential outcomes, and to enhance the rigour of that analysis.</p><p class="list-item">4.26 The Sustainable Stock Exchanges initiative has also developed a checklist in its model guidance on climate disclosure (<strong>“SSE Model Guidance on Climate Disclosure”</strong>). The SSE Model Guidance on Climate Disclosure sets out a simplified three stage process to the conduct of scenario analysis. First, the issuer should identify appropriate scenarios that align with its underlying assumptions and the key risks and opportunities of its sector or industry, and clearly explain the scenarios used. Second, the issuer may set boundaries of its scenario analysis with sufficient disclosure of the reasons for exclusion and inclusion. A smaller issuer may feel that an analysis of the direct operations sufficiently covers the climate-related risks and opportunities within each scenario, while a larger issuer and those in the financial sector should expand their analysis beyond their direct operations to include indirect GHG emissions (i.e. Scope 3 GHG emissions). Third, an issuer should evaluate its physical and transitional risks within the scenarios chosen. Mapping the severity and likelihood of the risks enables the issuer to develop a strategic plan for future scenarios. Additional guidance on scenario analysis as required by IFRS S2 has also been provided in the model guidance on sustainability-related financial disclosures issued by the Sustainable Stock Exchanges initiative in 2024.</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1 list-item"><em>Industry-based metrics and cross-industry metrics</em></p><p class="list-item">4.27 IFRS S2 requires an issuer to disclose industry-based metrics that are associated with common business models and activities in a particular industry. When an issuer provides industry-based metrics, it shall refer to and consider the relevant industry-based guidance to present fairly the climate-related risks and opportunities to which it is exposed.</p><p class="list-item">4.28 In addition to GHG emissions, IFRS S2 requires an issuer to disclose cross-industry metric categories including:</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1 list-item">(a) climate-related transition risks – the amount and percentage of assets or business activities vulnerable to transition risks;</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1 list-item">(b) climate-related physical risks – the amount and percentage of assets or business activities vulnerable to physical risks;</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1 list-item">(c) capital deployment – the amount of capital expenditure, financing or investment deployed towards climate-related risks and opportunities; and</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1 list-item">(d) internal carbon prices used to assess the cost of emissions.</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1">The industry-based guidance can assist issuers in meeting the requirements for disclosures related to cross-industry metric categories.</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1 list-item"><strong>Materiality</strong></p><p class="list-item">4.29 As guidance, sustainability reporting relates to the most important ESG risks and opportunities that will act as barriers or enablers to achieving business goals in the short, medium and long term. The omission or misstatement of these risks or opportunities could influence the decisions of investors. The sustainability reporting framework selected by the issuer may also contain a definition of materiality that the issuer should consider. For example, for climate-related disclosures, in accordance with the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards, materiality of information is judged in relation to whether omitting, misstating or obscuring the information could reasonably be expected to influence decisions of primary users of general purpose financial reports. This would require consideration of the characteristics of those users and of the issuer’s own circumstances.</p><p class="list-item">4.30 Generally, what is material in sustainability reporting would also be considered material in financial terms, if not in the immediate period, then over time.</p><p class="list-item">4.31 In assessing materiality of the ESG factors on which it reports, the issuer should first satisfy itself of the relevance of selected factors to its business strategy and outcomes. This has the benefit of focusing both executives and employees on uniform key risks and opportunities that deliver (or impede) desired outcomes.</p><p class="list-item">4.32 The issuer should use risk ranking and prioritisation to distil the material ESG factors. This process is similar to the widely-practised Enterprise Risk Management (“<strong>ERM</strong>”) process. The issuer should expand the breadth of the assessment to integrate ESG risk management structures into existing ERM structures or apply existing ERM structures to ESG risk management structures. Issuers may consider sustainability-related opportunities as part of business strategy.&nbsp;</p><p class="list-item">4.33 The Board should determine the material ESG factors and the issuer's response to the attendant risks and opportunities. Discussion with stakeholders contributes to an accurate appreciation of what is important in the business on an ongoing basis.</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1 list-item"><strong>Possible process and tools</strong></p><p class="list-item">4.34 A possible process for assessing ESG factors with material relevance to the business and business model are set out in the following paragraphs.</p><p class="list-item">4.35 In assessing materiality of the ESG factors on which it reports, the issuer may consider:</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1 list-item">(a) Value drivers</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1 list-item">(b) Stakeholder engagement</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1 list-item">(c) Risk management</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1 list-item">(d) External factors, for example sector, geography, economics, market, social, environment</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1 list-item">(e) Internal factors, for example business model, business cycle, strategy</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1 list-item">(f) Qualitative perspectives, for example operational, strategic, reputational and regulatory</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1 list-item">(g) Timeframe of these considerations</p><p class="list-item">4.36 The issuer may use the following Materiality Determination Process: Identify — Rate — Prioritise — Validate. The issuer should disclose the outcomes of this process in its sustainability report.</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1 list-item">(a) STEP 1: IDENTIFY. The issuer should identify the most pressing (material) factors (impact/opportunities) for the issuer (or for each subsidiary in the group). It will also help formulate management's approach and response, and identify where data collection needs to be strengthened.</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1 list-item">(b) STEP 2: RATE. Once the issues of the issuer and its subsidiaries have been explored, the issuer will need to cluster similar issues e.g. safety and health issues can be clustered together. If the issuer is a holding company, a rating process can be done to assess what issues are pervasive/most common across the group.</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1 list-item">(c) STEP 3: PRIORITISE. Once the issues of the issuer and its subsidiaries have been clustered and rated, the issuer will need to prioritise them using a matrix based on likelihood and impact.</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1 list-item">(d) STEP 4: VALIDATE. Once the issuer has prioritised its factors, they need to be internally validated and signed off by the Board.</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1 list-item"><strong>Policies, practices and performance</strong></p><p class="list-item">4.37 The issuer should devise policies and processes to adequately and effectively manage the risks associated with the identified material ESG factors, and describe key features of mitigation.</p><p class="list-item">4.38 A description of the ESG practices and performance across historical and the current reporting periods allows investors and the issuer itself to track its progress. These metrics also form the baseline from which the issuer chooses to set its targets, as informed by its strategic plan and financial reporting.</p><p class="list-item">4.39 An effective policy and operational response to sustainability risks and opportunities requires performance measurement and its linkage to performance incentives. Having a good performance measurement system allows the issuer to benchmark performance against stated objectives and facilitates comparison over time and across entities. Clearly linking sustainability risks and opportunities with strategy, other organisational risks, operational indicators, performance measures and performance incentives not only enhances understanding but provides an engine for improvement, innovation and accountability.</p><p class="list-item">4.40 A clear description of the issuer’s substantive response to ESG risks and opportunities, with a focus on its policies, practices and performance against targets, will bolster investors’ confidence in the Board and management.</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1 list-item"><strong>Sustainability reporting framework</strong></p><p class="list-item">4.41 The issuer should select a sustainability reporting framework which is appropriate for and suited to its industry and business model, and explain its choice. In doing so, the issuer should place importance on using a globally-recognised framework for its wider acceptance in an increasingly global marketplace. The issuer can be more easily understood and compared with its peers in Singapore as well as in other jurisdictions across the world. The issuer should exercise considerable caution if it chooses to deviate from generally-accepted frameworks. Where the issuer is applying a portion of a particular framework, the issuer should provide a general description of the extent of the issuer's application of the framework.</p><p class="list-item">4.42 Among the well-known and globally-recognised sustainability reporting frameworks, the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards and the Global Reporting Initiative (<strong>“GRI”</strong>) Standards set out generic sustainability factors and general principles and indicators that an issuer can use to report sustainability policies, practices, performance and targets. The SASB Standards also enables issuers to adopt an industry-specific approach to material ESG factors. The Integrated Reporting Framework (“<strong>&lt;IR&gt;</strong>”) also sets out a general framework for reporting. An issuer using &lt;IR&gt; should consider ESG factors when determining their material factors for inclusion in the integrated report. More than one sustainability reporting framework may be chosen as relevant to the issuer's business.</p><p class="list-item">4.43 For climate-related disclosures, the issuer should refer to paragraphs 4.7 to 4.28 of this Guide. Some issuers have used the Science Based Targets initiative or other sector-specific guidance to guide their GHG emissions reduction targets.</p><p class="list-item">4.44 The issuer is expected to follow the chosen framework(s) from year to year and build up its knowledge and understanding of how to report effectively. In turn, it can expect to be building up investors' and stakeholders' understanding, leading to increased confidence. In the absence of regulatory changes, only major changes in business strategy and/or model are likely to require change in sustainability reporting framework. This does not preclude examination of framework relevance from time to time.</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1 list-item"><strong>Time horizons used in the sustainability report</strong></p><p class="list-item">4.45 In making its sustainability report, the issuer should consider whether it would be useful to report matters for their relevance in the short, medium and long term. Accordingly, sustainability policies, practices, performance and targets would be considered along the same time horizons. The time horizons should be internally consistent with those used for strategic planning and financial reporting (e.g. useful life of assets, impairment testing etc.). Where they are not consistent, the reasons for the inconsistency should be disclosed. Typically the short-term is considered less than one year for banking and financial instruments. For the medium term, the issuer may wish to take reference from their typical planning horizon, investment cycle or plant renewal or other considerations relevant to its business. The long-term should be a useful time horizon over which expectations can be formed and efforts planned.</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1 list-item"><strong>Stakeholder engagement</strong></p><p class="list-item">4.46 Stakeholder engagement is integral to any business and would be conducted regularly. The issuer should consider ESG factors in their engagement with stakeholders, not just with investors, but also customers, staff, suppliers, regulators, local communities and others in the value chain. The issuer should monitor carefully its communication with stakeholders so as to avoid any information asymmetry as it may lead to unfair trading in the securities market.</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1 list-item"><strong>Group and investment holding company reporting</strong></p><p class="list-item">4.47 Where holding companies and operating subsidiaries are both listed and have to undertake sustainability reporting, the operating entities can report on the ESG factors within their scope of operations. If the ESG factors are also material to the holding company, unless disallowed by the relevant sustainability reporting framework or standard, the holding company may make reference in its sustainability report to the sustainability reports of the operating subsidiaries. If the holding company has material investee companies which are not subsidiaries, its sustainability report should include the selection and management of these investee companies.&nbsp;</p><p class="list-item"><strong>5. Internal Reviews and External Assurance</strong></p><p class="list-item">5.1 Internal reviews and external assurance increase stakeholder confidence in the accuracy and reliability of the sustainability information disclosed.</p><p class="list-item">5.2 These procedures over sustainability disclosures should be aligned with the issuer’s existing internal review or external assurance frameworks for other management information, such as financial information or production data.</p><p class="list-item">5.3 An internal review of the sustainability reporting process builds on the issuer’s existing governance structure, buttressed by adequate and effective internal controls and risk management systems. The internal audit function conducts the internal review, and may involve relevant functions, such as risk management, sustainability or other specialist functions. The identified processes relating to sustainability reporting should be incorporated into the internal audit plan, which should cover key aspects of the sustainability report; the review may take place over an audit cycle, which may span one or a few years in accordance with risk-based planning, as approved by the Audit Committee. The expectations of the Board, management and other stakeholders should be considered as part of the prioritisation. The internal review should be conducted in accordance with the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing (or any subsequent framework or standard including the International Professional Practices Framework and the Global Internal Audit Standards replacing such standards) issued by The Institute of Internal Auditors. If the issuer has reviewed that certain or all key aspects of the sustainability report has been externally assured, the issuer can, as part of its internal review, determine that no further internal review on such aspects of the sustainability report is required under a risk-based approach.&nbsp;</p><p class="list-item">5.4 An issuer whose sustainability reporting has already matured after several annual exercises would want to undertake external assurance by independent professional bodies to add credibility to the information disclosed and analysis undertaken. The issuer is encouraged to consider independent external assurance on selected important aspects of its sustainability report even in its initial years, expanding coverage in succeeding years.</p><p class="list-item">5.5 External assurance involves the engagement of a third party. The scope of the assurance may include a materiality assessment, and cover different aspects of the sustainability disclosures, for example:</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1 list-item">(a) data and its associated data collection process;</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1 list-item">(b) narratives;</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1 list-item">(c) compliance with the specified sustainability reporting framework;</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1 list-item">(d) process to identify sustainability information reported; and</p><p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1 list-item">(e) compliance with the Listing Rules.</p><p class="list-item">5.6 External assurance should be performed in accordance with recognised assurance standards, for example the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (or any subsequent sustainability-specific standard including the International Standard on Sustainability Assurance (ISSA) 5000), the ISAE 3410, the Singapore Standards on Assurance Engagement (SSAE) 3000 (or any subsequent sustainability-specific standard including the Singapore equivalent of the ISSA 5000), the SSAE 3410, the AA 1000 Assurance Standards or the ISO.&nbsp;</p><p class="list-item">5.7 An issuer that has conducted external assurance should disclose, in the sustainability report, that external assurance has been conducted, including the scope covered, the identity of the external assurer, the standards used, the level of assurance obtained and key findings.</p><p class="list-item"><strong>6. Form and Frequency of Sustainability Reporting</strong></p><p class="list-item">6.1 The issuer should report on sustainability at least once a year. The issuer's sustainability disclosure may be done in its annual report. The inclusion of sustainability risks and opportunities with the businesses' other risks and strategy in the same document presents advantages to the user. Sustainability reports contained within annual reports would observe annual report deadlines. Alternatively, if more appropriate for the circumstances of the issuer, the issuer may include a summary in its annual report and issue a full standalone sustainability report within 4 months of the end of the financial year, or where the issuer has conducted external assurance on the sustainability report, within 5 months of the end of the financial year.&nbsp;</p><p class="list-item">6.2 In either case, the issuer should make available its sustainability reports on SGXNet and on its company website. After a few years of sustainability reporting, the issuer may wish to maintain static information, such as, policies and historical sustainability information, on its website while presenting the current year's changes as well as performance in the annual sustainability report.</p><p class="list-item">6.3 To provide sufficient time for preparation, a newly listed issuer (other than an issuer that has an obligation to prepare a sustainability report under local legislation prior to listing) may issue its first sustainability report only in respect of its first full financial year after listing.</p><p class="list-item"><strong>7. Implementation of Sustainability Reporting and Climate-related Disclosures&nbsp;</strong></p><p class="list-item">7.1 For the first year of sustainability reporting, an issuer new to sustainability reporting should have at least the assessment of material ESG factors, policies and/or practices to address the factors; but if their reporting is lacking in qualitative or quantitative descriptions, they need only state progressive targets for reaching maturity of reporting and do their best to meet them in subsequent years.&nbsp;</p><p class="list-item">7.2 For climate-related disclosures, an example of how issuers could report over a few years using the (permanent) structural reliefs and (temporary) transition reliefs in the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards is illustrated in the table below. Issuers may decide on an implementation approach that best suits their circumstance and that complies with the listing requirements.</p><div class="rulebook-subitems-bold"><p class="text-align-center"><strong>Illustration of Possible Phased Approach</strong></p><table class="df_table" style="width:100%;" cellspacing="1"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:center;width:234px;"><strong>Year 1</strong></td><td style="text-align:center;width:234px;"><strong>Year 2</strong></td><td style="text-align:center;width:234px;"><strong>Year 3</strong></td></tr><tr><td style="vertical-align:top;">Qualitative climate-related scenario analysis, with disclosure of reliance on the (permanent) structural reliefs<sup>*#</sup>&nbsp;</td><td style="vertical-align:top;">Qualitative climate-related scenario analysis, with disclosure of reliance on the (permanent) structural reliefs<sup>*#</sup>&nbsp;</td><td style="vertical-align:top;">Climate-related scenario analysis with more quantitative outcomes</td></tr><tr><td style="vertical-align:top;">Qualitative disclosure of current financial effects of climate-related risks or opportunities as the effects are not separately identifiable or the level of measurement uncertainty is high&nbsp;<br>Qualitative disclosure of anticipated financial effects of climate-related risks or opportunities, with disclosure of reliance on the (permanent) structural reliefs<sup>*#</sup></td><td style="vertical-align:top;">Qualitative disclosure of current financial effects of climate-related risks or opportunities as the effects are not separately identifiable or the level of measurement uncertainty is high&nbsp;<br>Qualitative disclosure of anticipated financial effects of climate-related risks or opportunities, with disclosure of reliance on the (permanent) structural reliefs<sup>*#</sup></td><td style="vertical-align:top;">More quantitative disclosures of current and anticipated financial effects of climate-related risks or opportunities, with disclosure of reliance on the (permanent) structural reliefs*# where necessary</td></tr><tr><td style="vertical-align:top;">Limited disclosure of the amount or percentage of assets or business activities vulnerable to or aligned with climate-related risks and opportunities<sup>*</sup></td><td style="vertical-align:top;">Disclosure of the amount or percentage of assets or business activities vulnerable to or aligned with climate-related risks and opportunities<sup>*</sup></td><td style="vertical-align:top;">Disclosure of the amount or percentage of assets or business activities vulnerable to or aligned with climate-related risks and opportunities<sup>*</sup></td></tr><tr><td style="vertical-align:top;">Determined the scope of its value chain, including its breadth and composition, with disclosure of reliance on the (permanent) structural reliefs<sup>*</sup>&nbsp;</td><td style="vertical-align:top;">Determined the scope of its value chain, including its breadth and composition, with disclosure of reliance on the (permanent) structural reliefs<sup>*</sup>&nbsp;</td><td style="vertical-align:top;">Determined the scope of its value chain, including its breadth and composition, with disclosure of reliance on the (permanent) structural reliefs<sup>*</sup>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td style="vertical-align:top;">Disclosure of reliance on the (temporary) transition reliefs of (a) not using the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and (b) not providing comparative information in respect of the preceding period&nbsp;</td><td style="vertical-align:top;">Use the Greenhouse Gas Protocol to calculate its GHG emissions<br>Comparative information in respect of the preceding period</td><td style="vertical-align:top;">Use the Greenhouse Gas Protocol to calculate its GHG emissions<br>Comparative information in respect of the preceding period</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><p>For STI Constituents, to disclose Scope 3 GHG emissions from FYC 2026</p><p>For issuers already disclosing Scope 3 GHG emissions, continue to disclose Scope 3 GHG emissions<br>For other issuers, to build capabilities to report Scope 3 GHG emissions</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">* <em>Using all reasonable and supportable information that is available to the issuer at the reporting date without undue cost or effort</em><br><sup>#</sup> <em>Considering the issuer’s skills, capabilities and resources</em></td></tr></tbody></table><div><strong>8.

Good corporate governance therefore embodies both enterprise (performance) and accountability (conformance).</div><div class="list">  2 There is, however, no conclusive evidence that any one model of corporate governance leads to superior corporate performance. This is because the appropriate governance model will vary not only between companies but also over time for any individual company. This is particularly so given the speed with which new companies are forming and the fundamental changes to corporate structures being wrought by new technologies and globalisation. These changes will result in quite different models of corporate governance emerging from those to which we are accustomed.</div><div class="list">  3 Nevertheless, good corporate governance matters, especially in situations where there may be significant conflicts of interests between shareholders and Management, such as in certain corporate acquisitions; management buyouts; financial reporting; performance appraisal, hiring and replacement of senior management; and executive compensation. Investors, especially international institutional investors, increasingly demand high corporate governance standards in companies that they invest in.</div><div class="list">  4 In a recent McKinsey Investor Opinion Survey of 200 institutional investors, 89 percent of respondents in Asia said that they would pay more for the shares of a well-governed company than for those of a poorly governed company with comparable financial performance. The fact that a majority of investors say they already take corporate governance into account when making investment decisions is a powerful argument in favour of corporate governance reform.</div><div class="list">  5 In addition, with the intent of improving corporate governance in a corporation and promoting enterprise and accountability, the World Bank and OECD established an Investor Responsibility Taskforce. Specifically, the Investor Responsibility Taskforce seeks to ensure that countries and companies are properly rewarded by the markets if they make governance reforms. With more than $3 trillion in assets managed by its members, its objective is to encourage investors to pay more attention to corporate governance issues so as to speed up the flow of funds to those countries and companies that make progress on the reform agenda.</div><div class="list">  6 In Singapore, the results of the Pricewaterhouse Coopers ("PWC") Corporate Governance Survey of Institutional Investors, published in 2000, indicated that we need to continuously improve its standard of corporate governance, to provide a climate conducive to the orderly development of the capital markets and to meet the increasing expectations of investors.</div><div class="list">  7 This Report and the accompanying Code of Corporate Governance ("Code") seeks to encourage Singapore listed companies to enhance shareholder value through good corporate governance. It is not meant to be a panacea. It, however, recognises the need to balance enterprise and accountability in creating long-term shareholder value. It allows companies flexibility in choosing its approach to corporate governance, subject to appropriate disclosure to, and approval by, shareholders. Companies must take upon themselves the responsibility for adopting governance practices best suited to their circumstances, built around sound principles. The principles and guidelines in the Code are not meant to unduly restrict corporate governance policies and practices. Each company must decide which governance practices are relevant to investor decision-making and make disclosure accordingly. The market will judge each approach as it sees fit.</div><div class="list">  8 However, in order for shareholders to have a sound basis for making their investment decisions and to assess the appropriateness of a company's corporate governance practices, companies must provide appropriate disclosure of their corporate governance framework and practices. Such disclosures would also allow other market participants to play a more active role in promoting good corporate governance by companies.</div><p>  <strong>Alternative Approaches to Promoting Good Corporate Governance</strong></p><div class="list">  9 In theory, there are at least three possible regulatory approaches to promoting good corporate governance:  <div class="list">    1. A <strong>prescriptive approach</strong> that requires companies to adopt specific corporate governance practices;  </div>  <div class="list">    2. A <strong>non-prescriptive approach</strong> that allows companies to determine their own corporate governance practices, subject to appropriate disclosures of corporate governance practices that are adopted; and  </div>  <div class="list">    3. A <strong>balanced approach</strong> that specifies corporate governance best practices but allows companies to depart from these practices subject to appropriate disclosure.  </div></div><div class="list">  10 Although a prescriptive approach may be appropriate in certain circumstances, for example where capital markets are undeveloped, such an approach is inconsistent with the disclosure-based philosophy to regulation that Singapore is moving towards. Further, a prescriptive approach assumes that a "one size fits all" approach is appropriate, but as discussed earlier, what is good corporate governance is likely to vary across companies and over time.</div><div class="list">  11 A non-prescriptive approach to corporate governance is probably best exemplified by the approach in the US. In the US, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and the various stock exchanges generally do not prescribe corporate governance practices that companies should adopt, although some private sector bodies and major institutional investors have developed codes that embody what they consider to be good corporate governance. Instead, the SEC and the stock exchanges emphasise high disclosure standards, including disclosure of corporate governance practices that companies have adopted, so that investors can assess the corporate governance of companies they invest in. Even in the US, however, there are instances where specific corporate governance practices are prescribed &#8212; a good example is the requirement of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") and NASDAQ for listed companies to have an audit committee with at least three directors, all independent. Australia is another example of a country that has adopted a largely non-prescriptive approach. Companies listed on the Australian Stock Exchange ("ASX") are required to describe specific corporate governance practices that they have adopted, and companies are encouraged to pay attention to best practice recommendations that have been published. However, the ASX has not adopted a specific corporate governance code that companies should follow, nor does it require companies to disclose non-compliance with any particular code.</div><div class="list">  12 A balanced approach is also followed by markets that adopt the disclosure-based philosophy to regulation. For example, the Canadian and UK markets largely follow the disclosure-based approach to regulation but have nevertheless adopted codes of corporate governance that include fairly extensive specification of corporate governance practices that companies should adopt. However, the flexibility to companies is preserved in most areas through the voluntary nature of these codes. Subject to appropriate descriptions of corporate governance practices and disclosure of non-compliance with specific provisions, companies can depart from specific provisions in the code under the Listing Rules.</div><div class="list">  13 After careful consideration of the disclosure philosophy that Singapore is embracing, the state of development of the Singapore capital markets, and the institutional features of the corporate governance landscape (including the ownership profiles of Singapore listed companies and the activism of shareholders), the Corporate Governance Committee ("CGC" or "Committee") has decided that, at this particular time, the balanced approach adopted in markets such as the UK and Canada provide the best approach for improving corporate governance in Singapore. <strong>The Committee proposes that all companies listed on the Singapore Exchange ("SGX") be required, as a requirement in the Listing Manual, to give a complete description of their corporate governance practices with specific references to each of the guidelines set out in the Code, and where they deviate from these best practices, they should disclose these non-compliance with appropriate explanations.</strong> In CGC's view, while the SGX has the responsibility of ensuring that listed companies disclose their corporate governance practices as well as their reasons for any deviation from the Code, the quality of the explanations is for the market to assess and judge.</div><div class="list">  14 The CGC is cognisant that companies need time to gear themselves up for the higher standards of corporate governance and disclosure, and requiring immediate compliance may result in the letter rather than the spirit of the Code being followed. <strong>Listed companies are thus required to disclose</strong> <strong>their corporate governance practices and give explanations for deviations from the Code in their annual reports for Annual General Meetings ("AGMs") held from 1 Jan 2003 onwards. However, listed companies are encouraged to comply with the Code before that, if they are able to do so.</strong></div><div class="list">  15 It is hoped that the companies would observe the spirit, and not just blindly follow the letter of the Code, as the latter may not always achieve the intended results. On the issue of independence, for instance, it could be argued that two directors, who whilst unrelated to each other, but who have been friends since young would not be likely to deal with each other with objectivity. Conversely, it may very well be the case that two directors who are related to each other would be less restrained in being critical or offering contradictory viewpoints to each other.</div><div class="list">  16 As the Singapore capital markets deepen and mature, and as market mechanisms for promoting good corporate governance develop, the approach recommended by the CGC can be reviewed in future and can evolve accordingly.</div><p>  <strong>The Code of Corporate Governance</strong></p><div class="list">  17 Before deciding on the recommendations, the CGC conducted a month-long public consultation in December 2000. It received numerous feedback from various quarters, many of which were positive. The Committee felt encouraged by the level of interest in this matter and the reassuring comments, and would like to take this opportunity to thank those who had contributed to this process. Several of the points raised in the feedback have indeed been incorporated into this Report and the accompanying Code.</div><div class="list">  18 The objective of the Code is not to prescribe corporate behaviour in detail but to essentially secure sufficient disclosure so that investors and others can assess a company's performance and governance practices and respond in an informed way.</div><div class="list">  19 The Code is divided into four main sections:  <div class="list">    &#8226;&#160;&#160; Board Matters;  </div>  <div class="list">    &#8226;&#160;&#160; Remuneration Matters;  </div>  <div class="list">    &#8226;&#160;&#160; Accountability and Audit; and  </div>  <div class="list">    &#8226;&#160;&#160; Communication with Shareholders.  </div></div><div class="list">  20 The recommendations are presented in the format of principles and guidance notes. The Committee now sets forth its underlying thoughts in arriving at the recommendations.</div><p>  <strong>Board Matters</strong></p><div class="list">  21 In the McKinsey survey (2000), 77 percent of the respondents in Asia ranked board practices to be at least as important as financial issues in stock selection. Indeed, there is no substitute for having good board practices and ensuring the integrity of members appointed to the Board of Directors. Without integrity, companies may be able to meet prescribed rules and yet still frustrate the intent of any corporate governance code. Meeting the form but not the substance of the Code would not lead to improved corporate governance.</div><div class="list">  22 Other than charting corporate strategy, the Board of Directors is chiefly responsible for monitoring managerial performance and achieving an adequate return for shareholders, while preventing conflicts of interest and balancing competing demands on the corporation. Most governance guidelines and codes of best practice assert that the Board should explicitly assume responsibility for the stewardship of the corporation and emphasise that board responsibilities are distinct from management responsibilities.</div><div class="list">  23 Being primarily responsible for the workings of the Board, the chairman's role in securing good corporate governance is crucial. To provide some guidance, the Code sets out some examples of the role and responsibilities of the chairman. On the other hand, the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"), representing management, shall have the general executive responsibility for the conduct of the business and affairs of the company. In carrying out his duties, the CEO should work closely with the Board to implement the corporate policies set by the Board and to realise a common vision for the company.</div><div class="list">  24 There are two views on the issue of the leadership structure. The first, as in the case of the UK and Australia, is a dual leadership structure, i.e. where there is a separate CEO and chairman on the Board. The argument is that with a clear division of responsibilities at the head of the company, the likelihood of an individual or a group of individuals having unfettered powers of decision will be reduced. It is noted that a separation is most effective if the chairman is independent. The second view is that such a structure is not necessary as it may hinder the decision-making process of the company. As a principle, the CGC is inclined towards the former view, so as to help ensure an appropriate balance of power and increased accountability. Such a separation (of the chairman and CEO) is important because it enhances the independence of the board in monitoring management. This is especially important in Singapore where the board tends to include a significant executive element, unlike most boards of the best-managed companies in the US, where almost all directors are independent. Moreover, as other mechanisms that discipline management (such as an active take-over market and shareholder activism) are less developed here, there is this increased need for a dual leadership structure.</div><div class="list">  25 Philosophically, there is also merit in requiring the chairman and CEO of the company to be unrelated, in order to avoid a significant concentration of power. However, the Committee notes that a company whose chairman and CEO are related to each other could be as well managed as one which does not. The Committee has decided that while it would not advocate one way or the other, it would require any such relationships to be disclosed.</div><div class="list">  26 The CGC subscribes to the view that Boards must have some degree of independence from Management in order to effectively fulfil their responsibilities. Accordingly, the Committee recommends that independent directors make up at least one-third of the Board. Such independent board members play an important role in areas where the interests of Management, the company and shareholders may diverge, such as executive remuneration, succession planning, changes of corporate control and the audit function. Furthermore, they are able to bring an objective view to the evaluation of the performance of the Board and Management.</div><div class="list">  27 The Committee also views the information on attendance of individual directors at Board and all specialised committee meetings as something basic but important, especially when there is an increasing trend for Boards to set up committees to perform specific functions delegated to them. Whilst attendance at Board meetings itself is not the sole or a conclusive indicator of the level of commitment or competence of a director, disclosure of such information will enable investors to come closer to making informed decisions as to whether to approve the re-election of the directors concerned.</div><div class="list">  28 The setting up of a Nominating Committee ("NC") is viewed by the CGC to be one of the most important elements of a good Board. It is intended to make the process of board appointments transparent and to assess the effectiveness of the Board as a whole and of individual directors.</div><div class="list">  29 While most codes do not establish performance criteria for Boards, a range of performance measurement tools is listed in the guidance notes. It is hoped this will not only allow flexibility on the part of companies to utilise measures that are most applicable to them, but also allow investors to compare the company with its industry peers. The Committee is of the view that ultimately, it should be left to the NC to recommend, and the Board to decide, the criteria upon which the Board's performance is to be evaluated.</div><p>  <strong>Remuneration Matters</strong></p><div class="list">  30 The principal objectives of the CGC's recommendations on remuneration matters are to facilitate appropriateness, transparency and accountability on the issue of executive remuneration. These are premised on the fundamental principle of accountability to shareholders.</div><div class="list">  31 The Committee has recommended principles for executive remuneration, which hopes to place greater weightage on individual performance of executive directors and key managers, as well as corporate performance, as determinants of remuneration.</div><div class="list">  32 The recommendations relating to the setting out of processes in remuneration-setting, in particular, the institutionalisation of remuneration committees, seek to provide a greater degree of independence, impartiality and transparency in remuneration-setting.</div><div class="list">  33 The principles and guidance notes relating to the disclosure of corporate remuneration practices are intended to provide investors complete and meaningful information on the application of the Board's remuneration policies in the context of the performance of the company. These disclosure requirements again promote the fundamental tenets of accountability and fairness. Disclosures will provide shareholders, in an easily understood format, with the information they need to know on the quantum and components of remuneration, in conjunction with the company's performance and stated policies.</div><div class="list">  34 The Committee has carefully considered the extent of disclosure of individual directors' remuneration. On the one hand, the disclosure of individual directors' remuneration is in line with international best practice, and would be of benefit to shareholders, who have a right to know how directors are being compensated from corporate funds. However, this has to be balanced against the argument that such a practice might erode the personal privacy of directors of publicly listed companies (particularly in view of the fact that Singapore is a relatively small community), and might create inflationary pressure to ratchet directors' remuneration upwards. The Committee has therefore decided to recommend, at the minimum, that companies disclose the names of directors earning remuneration within bands of S$250,000. However, as best practice, companies are strongly encouraged to fully disclose the individual remuneration of directors. The Committee notes that the International Organisation of Securities Commissions ("IOSCO") has recommended, albeit in the context of prospectuses, that directors are required to disclose their individual remuneration.</div><div class="list">  35 There arises an issue as to whether these remuneration disclosure requirements should be extended to key executives of the company (over and above the directors). The practice in the US and Australia is to require the disclosure of the top-earning executives. After considering feedback received during the public consultation, the Committee decided to extend the disclosure of remuneration to at least the top 5 key executives of the company, so as to give investors a picture of how remuneration is distributed in the top tier of the company's Management</div><div class="list">  36 It is also hoped that corporations will utilise the use of longer-term incentive schemes, including shares and share option schemes. This is to align the interests of directors and executives with those of shareholders through holding a direct equity stake in the future of the company. Whilst the alignment of interest is important, shareholders also need to be adequately informed on such schemes and to understand the premise of such schemes, to ensure they are receiving due reward for the dilution that equity participation entails.</div><div class="list">  37 It should be stated that the guidelines are not meant to unduly stultify corporate policies on remuneration. Companies will still retain the flexibility to attract, retain and motivate employees in the interests of improved corporate performance.</div><p>  <strong>Accountability and Audit</strong></p><div class="list">  38 In the area of "Accountability and Audit", the respective roles of the Board and Management tend to overlap. In making its recommendations, the Committee seeks to draw attention to the roles and responsibilities of Management in the corporate governance process, as this will present the roles and responsibilities of the Board in better perspective. In this respect, the CGC stresses the accountability of Management to the Board, and the importance of providing all (both executive and nonexecutive) members of the Board with monthly management accounts. Also, the Committee recommends "quarterly reporting", so that minority shareholders have access to more timely information.</div><div class="list">  39 Firstly, the CGC emphasises the importance of the independence of the Audit Committee ("AC"). It subscribes to the view that the chairman of the AC should be an independent director and that ACs should establish a practice of meeting with the external auditors and the internal auditors, without the presence of the company's Management.</div><div class="list">  40 Secondly, the Committee emphasises the importance of the internal audit function being independent of the Management as the internal audit function is one of the principal means by which the AC is able to carry out its responsibilities effectively. There should be safeguards to protect the independence of the internal auditor. Accordingly, the CGC recommends that the internal auditor should report directly to the AC. In practice, the internal auditor's responsibilities often include activities other than internal audit. For the internal audit function to be effective, it is important that the internal auditor is not responsible for auditing its own activities.</div><div class="list">  41 Thirdly, the Committee emphasises the importance of Management's responsibility in maintaining a sound system of internal controls, and the Board's oversight responsibility to ensure that this is done. Whilst the Board collectively shares this responsibility, we would emphasise that it is the AC's specific role to ensure that an annual review of all material controls is conducted. While the Committee subscribes to the view that the Board should comment on the adequacy of the internal controls, it feels that the procedures for establishing whether the controls are adequate should be left to the market to develop.</div><div class="list">  42 The CGC subscribes to the view that the members of the AC should be appropriately qualified, as this will enhance the members' confidence and independence in the committee's dealing with the Management, as well as with both the external and the internal auditors. In this respect, the Committee recommends that at least two members should have accounting or related financial management expertise instead of one member as required by the NYSE. However, like the US requirement, the Committee emphasises that such qualification should be left to the Board's interpretation in its business judgement. The Committee feels that the requirement for at least two members to have the requisite expertise or experience would strengthen the objectivity of the AC's views and enhance the effectiveness of the AC when it liases with the external auditors.</div><div class="list">  43 The Committee also subscribes to the view that the internal audit function should be adequately staffed, and accorded appropriate standing and authority to enable the internal auditor to gain access to information and the senior members of the management team. This is important for the internal audit function of the company to operate effectively.</div><p>  <strong>Communication with Shareholders</strong></p><div class="list">  44 The principles and guidance notes in this section seek to encourage companies to engage in more effective communication with shareholders. The PWC survey (2000) showed that the manner and frequency with which information is disseminated to shareholders and/or analysts is clearly a key factor in any investment decision. In particular, 74 percent of the respondents wanted greater disclosure and transparency in the annual reports and financial statements.</div><div class="list">  45 The AGM is often the main opportunity for small shareholders to be fully briefed on the company's activities and to question the Management on both operational and governance matters. Shareholders have the right to participate in, and to be sufficiently informed on, major corporate developments. Companies should be encouraged to welcome the views and inputs of shareholders, and to address investors' concerns. Additionally, in disclosing information, companies should be as descriptive, detailed and forthcoming as possible, and avoid meaningless boiler-plate statements.</div><div class="list">  46 The Committee is mindful of the risk that close contact between companies and its shareholders might lead to different shareholders receiving different information. In particular, unpublished price-sensitive information may often be disclosed at analysts' briefings and private conversations with major investors. The Committee therefore subscribes to the view that all investors, whether institutional or retail, should be entitled to the same level of communication and disclosure. If such information can reasonably be expected to materially affect the market activity and the share price, the company in fact has an obligation under the SGX Listing Rules to disclose to the Exchange and shareholders as soon as reasonably practicable. Further, one of the OECD Principles of Corporate Governance states that processes and procedures for general shareholder meetings should allow for equitable treatment of all shareholders. Such an equitable and equal treatment should be extended to the issue of disclosure. The Committee felt that in the event where a company unintentionally or inadvertently discloses certain information to a select group, it should be required to make the same disclosure to the public. This could be done by way of a press release, an announcement on the company's website, or other comparable means.</div><div class="list">  47 The Committee notes that the default requirement in the Companies Act is that voting must be made by physical attendance, whether of the registered shareholder or his nominated proxy. Telephonic, electronic, or other modes of absentia voting is however allowed if it is specifically provided for in the company's articles of association. The Committee believes that it is important to encourage shareholders to play a more active role in voting at general meetings. This can be done by allowing absentia or by harnessing new electronic voting methods such as mail, email, fax, etc, if the shareholders are agreeable to such a process.</div><div class="list">  48 The Committee notes that the UK Combined Code requires the chairmen of the audit, remuneration and nomination committees to be available to answer questions at the AGM. The Committee feels that it is also important that the company's external auditors be present as well, to assist the directors in addressing any relevant queries by shareholders.</div><p>  <strong>Future Evolution of the Code</strong></p><div class="list">  49 Needless to say, the Code will continue to evolve over time, to maintain its relevance and applicability with the changing corporate landscape. The Committee therefore suggests that the Singapore Exchange, with inputs from interested parties such as bodies representing directors, investors, fund managers, accountants, etc, spearhead the initiative to co-ordinate future reviews or updates of the Code. Such an effort to review the Code could also be conducted by the panel recommended by the Disclosure and Accounting Standards Committee to undertake the task of reviewing and enhancing reporting and disclosure standards in Singapore. We hope to see the continued involvement of industry representatives in these future reviews.</div><div class="list">  50 The Committee is pleased to set forth its recommendations.</div>

The Board should identify in the company's Annual Report each director it considers to be independent. The Board should determine, taking into account the views of the Nominating Committee ("NC"), whether the director is independent in character and judgement and whether there are relationships or circumstances which are likely to affect, or could appear to affect, the director's judgement. Directors should disclose to the Board any such relationship as and when it arises. The Board should state its reasons if it determines that a director is independent notwithstanding the existence of relationships or circumstances which may appear relevant to its determination, including the following:</span>  <div class="list">    <span class="me">(a) a director being employed by the company or any of its related corporations for the current or any of the past three financial years;</span>  </div>  <div class="list">    <span class="me">(b) a director who has an immediate family member who is, or has been in any of the past three financial years, employed by the company or any of its related corporations and whose remuneration is determined by the remuneration committee;</span>  </div>  <div class="list">    <span class="me">(c) a director, or an immediate family member, accepting any significant compensation from the company or any of its related corporations for the provision of services, for the current or immediate past financial year, other than compensation for board service;</span>  </div>  <div class="list">    <span class="me">(d) a director:</span>    <div class="list">      <span class="me">(i) who, in the current or immediate past financial year, is or was; or</span>    </div>    <div class="list">      <span class="me">(ii) whose immediate family member, in the current or immediate past financial year, is or was,</span>    </div>    <div class="noindent">      <span class="me">a 10%shareholder of, or a partner in (with 10% or more stake), or an executive officer of, or a director of, any organisation to which the company or any of its subsidiaries made, or from which the company or any of its subsidiaries received, significant payments or material services (which may include auditing, banking, consulting and legal services), in the current or immediate past financial year.

If a person is proposed to be appointed as an alternate director to an independent director, the NC and the Board should review and conclude that the person would similarly qualify as an independent director, before his appointment as an alternate director.

No director should be involved in deciding his own remuneration.</span></div><p>  <strong><span class="me"><u>Guidelines:</u></span></strong></p><div class="list">  <span class="me">7.1 The Board should establish a Remuneration Committee ("<strong>RC</strong>") with written terms of reference which clearly set out its authority and duties. The RC should comprise at least three directors, the majority of whom, including the RC Chairman, should be independent. All of the members of the RC should be non-executive directors. This is to minimise the risk of any potential conflict of interest. The Board should disclose in the company's Annual Report the names of the members of the RC and the key terms of reference of the RC, explaining its role and the authority delegated to it by the Board.</span></div><div class="list">  <span class="me">7.2 The RC should review and recommend to the Board a general framework of remuneration for the Board and key management personnel<sup>8</sup>. The RC should also review and recommend to the Board the specific remuneration packages for each director as well as for the key management personnel. The RC's recommendations should be submitted for endorsement by the entire Board. The RC should cover all aspects of remuneration, including but not limited to director's fees, salaries, allowances, bonuses, options, share-based incentives and awards, and benefits in kind.</span></div><div class="list">  <span class="me">7.3 If necessary, the RC should seek expert advice inside and/or outside the company on remuneration of all directors. The RC should ensure that existing relationships, if any, between the company and its appointed remuneration consultants will not affect the independence and objectivity of the remuneration consultants. The company should also disclose the names and firms of the remuneration consultants in the annual remuneration report, and include a statement on whether the remuneration consultants have any such relationships with the company.</span></div><div class="list">  <span class="me">7.4 The RC should review the company's obligations arising in the event of termination of the executive directors' and key management personnel's contracts of service, to ensure that such contracts of service contain fair and reasonable termination clauses which are not overly generous. The RC should aim to be fair and avoid rewarding poor performance.</span></div><p>  <strong><span class="me">LEVEL AND MIX OF REMUNERATION</span></strong></p><p>  <strong><span class="me"><u>Principle:</u></span></strong></p><div class="list">  <span class="me">8 The level and structure of remuneration should be aligned with the long-term interest and risk policies of the company, and should be appropriate to attract, retain and motivate (a) the directors to provide good stewardship of the company, and (b) key management personnel to successfully manage the company. However, companies should avoid paying more than is necessary for this purpose.</span></div><p>  <strong><span class="me"><u>Guidelines:</u></span></strong></p><div class="list">  <span class="me">8.1 A significant and appropriate proportion of executive directors' and key management personnel's remuneration should be structured so as to link rewards to corporate and individual performance.Such performance-related remuneration should be aligned with the interests of shareholders and promote the long-term success of the company. It should take account of the risk policies of the company, be symmetric with risk outcomes and be sensitive to the time horizon of risks. There should be appropriate and meaningful measures for the purpose of assessing executive directors' and key management personnel's performance.</span></div><div class="list">  <span class="me">8.2 Long-term incentive schemes are generally encouraged for executive directors and key management personnel. The RC should review whether executive directors and key management personnel should be eligible for benefits under long-term incentive schemes. The costs and benefits of long-term incentive schemes should be carefully evaluated. In normal circumstances, offers of shares or grants of options or other forms of deferred remuneration should vest over a period of time. The use of vesting schedules, whereby only a portion of the benefits can be exercised each year, is also strongly encouraged. Executive directors and key management personnel should be encouraged to hold their shares beyond the vesting period, subject to the need to finance any cost of acquiring the shares and associated tax liability.</span></div><div class="list">  <span class="me">8.3 The remuneration of non-executive directors should be appropriate to the level of contribution, taking into account factors such as effort and time spent, and responsibilities of the directors. Non-executive directors should not be over-compensated to the extent that their independence may be compromised. The RC should also consider implementing schemes to encourage non-executive directors to hold shares in the company so as to better align the interests of such non-executive directors with the interests of shareholders.</span></div><div class="list">  <span class="me">8.4 Companies are encouraged to consider the use of contractual provisions to allow the company to reclaim incentive components of remuneration from executive directors and key management personnel in exceptional circumstances of misstatement of financial results, or of misconduct resulting in financial loss to the company.</span></div><p>  <strong><span class="me">DISCLOSURE ON REMUNERATION</span></strong></p><p>  <strong><u><span class="me">Principle:</span></u></strong></p><span class="me">9 Every company should provide clear disclosure of its remuneration policies, level and mix of remuneration, and the procedure for setting remuneration, in the company's Annual Report.

                <p>  <span class="me">The Code on Corporate Governance focuses on providing principles and guidelines to listed companies and their Boards to spur them towards a high standard of corporate governance. To ensure that these standards are achieved and sustained in practice, active and constructive shareholder relations is crucial. Bearing in mind the diversity of shareholders in a listed company and their differing investment objectives, this statement sets out certain broad views on the role of shareholders.</span></p><p>  <span class="me">The objective of creating sustainable and financially sound enterprises that offer long-term value to shareholders is best served through a constructive relationship between shareholders and the Boards of companies.</span></p><p>  <span class="me">Shareholder inputs on governance matters are useful to strengthen the overall environment for good governance policies and practices, and convey shareholders' expectations to the Board.

                <h2> Introduction</h2>
            </a>
                        <div class="node-body">
                <div class="list">  <span class="me">1. Corporate governance refers to having the appropriate people, processes and structures to direct and manage the business and affairs of the company to enhance long-term shareholder value, whilst taking into account the interests of other stakeholders. Companies that embrace the tenets of good governance, including accountability, transparency and sustainability, are more likely to engender investor confidence and achieve long-term sustainable business performance.</span></div><div class="list">  <span class="me">2. The Code of Corporate Governance (the "Code"), which is applicable to listed companies in Singapore on a comply-or-explain basis, first came into effect on 1 January 2003. The Code aims to promote high levels of corporate governance in Singapore by putting forth Principles of good corporate governance and Provisions with which companies are expected to comply. The Practice Guidance complements the Code by providing guidance on the application of the Principles and Provisions and setting out best practices for companies. Adoption of the Practice Guidance is voluntary.</span></div><div class="list">  <span class="me">3. The Code takes as its starting point a recognition that the Board has the dual role of setting strategic direction, and of setting the company&#039;s approach to governance. This includes establishing an appropriate culture, values and ethical standards of conduct at all levels of the company. The role of the Board is therefore broader than that of providing oversight. A well-constituted Board fosters more complete discussions, leading to better decisions and enhanced business performance. This version of the Code expands on the need for a strong and independent element on the Board, along with a diverse skill set.</span></div><div class="list">  <span class="me">4. Given the centrality of the Board to good corporate governance, it is fundamental that the Chairman of the Board (the "Chairman") sets the right tone. The Chairman should encourage a full and frank exchange of views, drawing out contributions from all directors so that the debate benefits from the full diversity of views around the boardroom table. The Chairman should seek to stimulate and engender a robust yet collegiate setting, set the right ethical and behavioural tone, and provide leadership to the Board.</span></div><div class="list">  <span class="me">5. Good corporate governance is good for the company, with a well-governed company better placed to perform over the longer-term. The Code should not be seen as burdensome but should help companies by giving clear direction on good Board and Management practices that will help build investor and stakeholder confidence. For this outcome, a culture of substantive compliance, rather than a checklist approach, is crucial. A sustainably successful company is good for myriad stakeholders: employees, suppliers, customers, shareholders, as well as society at large.</span></div><p>  <strong><u><span class="me">Comply or explain</span></u></strong></p><div class="list">  <span class="me">6. This updated version of the Code represents a significant development both in terms of the way the Code is structured, and the way in which companies are required to describe their corporate governance practices.</span></div><div class="list">  <span class="me">7. This version of the Code has at its core broad Principles of corporate governance. Compliance with, and observation of, these Principles is mandatory. These Principles set out broadly accepted characteristics of good corporate governance. Companies are required<sup>1</sup> to describe their corporate governance practices with reference to both the Principles and Provisions, and how the company&#039;s practices conform to the Principles.</span></div><div class="list">  <span class="me">8. The Provisions that underpin the Principles are designed to support compliance with the Principles. These Provisions, which replace the Guidelines of previous Codes, are drafted in a simple and direct manner, and describe the tenets of good corporate governance. Companies are expected to comply with the Provisions, and variations from Provisions are acceptable to the extent that companies explicitly state and explain how their practices are consistent with the aim and philosophy of the Principle in question. The explanations of variations should be comprehensive and meaningful.</span></div><div class="list">  <span class="me">9. The emphasis of the Code is for companies to provide thoughtful and meaningful explanations around their practices, and for investors to carefully consider these discussions as part of their engagements with companies. Frank and informed dialogue between companies and their shareholders is a central tenet of good corporate governance, and encourages more active stewardship. Better engagement between these parties will benefit the company and investors.</span></div><hr style="height:1px;" /><p>  <span class="me"><sup>1</sup> <a href="/node/5079">Rule 710</a> of the SGX Listing Rules (Mainboard) / <a href="/node/3361">Rule 710</a> of the SGX Listing Rules (Catalist)</span></p>

                        <div class="node-body">
                <p>  <strong>Board's Role</strong></p><p>  The Board's role is to:</p><div class="list">  (a) provide entrepreneurial leadership, and set strategic objectives, which should include appropriate focus on value creation, innovation and sustainability;</div><div class="list">  (b) ensure that the necessary resources are in place for the company to meet its strategic objectives;</div><div class="list">  (c) establish and maintain a sound risk management framework to effectively monitor and manage risks, and to achieve an appropriate balance between risks and company performance;</div><div class="list">  (d) constructively challenge Management and review its performance;</div><div class="list">  (e) instil an ethical corporate culture and ensure that the company's values, standards, policies and practices are consistent with the culture; and</div><div class="list">  (f) ensure transparency and accountability to key stakeholder groups.</div><p>  <strong>Scope of Director Duties</strong></p><p>  Directors should be aware of their duties at law, which includes acting in good faith and the best interests of the company; exercising due care, skills and diligence; and avoiding conflicts of interest. Directors should also put in place policies, structures and mechanisms to ensure compliance with legislative and regulatory requirements, establish appropriate tone-at-the-top, desired organisational culture and standards of ethical behaviour.</p><p>  While the duties imposed by law are the same for all directors, a listed Board will generally have different classes of directors (executive, non-executive and independent directors) with different roles:</p><div class="list">  &#8226;&#160;&#160; <strong>Executive Directors (EDs)</strong> are usually members of senior management, and involved in the day-to-day running of the business. Executive directors are expected to:  <div class="list">    (a) provide insights on the company's day-to-day operations, as appropriate;  </div>  <div class="list">    (b) provide Management's views without undermining management accountability to the Board; and  </div>  <div class="list">    (c) collaborate closely with non-executive directors for the long term success of the company.  </div></div><div class="list">  &#8226;&#160;&#160; <strong>Non-Executive Directors (NEDs)</strong> are not part of Management. They are not employees of the company and do not participate in the company's day-to-day management. NEDs are expected to:  <div class="list">    (a) be familiar with the business and stay informed of the activities of the company;  </div>  <div class="list">    (b) constructively challenge Management and help develop proposals on strategy;  </div>  <div class="list">    (c) review the performance of Management in meeting agreed goals and objectives; and  </div>  <div class="list">    (d) participate in decisions on the appointment, assessment and remuneration of the executive directors and key management personnel generally.  </div></div><div class="list">  &#8226;&#160;&#160; <strong>Independent Directors (IDs)</strong> are NEDs who are deemed independent by the Board (see Provision 2.1 and Practice Guidance 2 on criteria for director independence). IDs have the duties of the NEDs, and additionally provide an independent and objective check on Management. In certain cases, the SGX Listing Rules require IDs to make certain decisions and determinations. However, IDs should avoid focusing solely on the duties relating to compliance with rules. As with all directors, they are to act in the best interests of the company as a whole and not of any particular group of shareholders or stakeholders.</div><p>  <strong>Conflicts of Interest</strong></p><p>  The Board should have clear policies and procedures for dealing with conflicts of interest. Where the director faces a conflict of interest, he or she should disclose this and recuse himself or herself from meetings and decisions involving the issue. For instance, if the Chairman of the Board (Chairman) is a member of the Nominating Committee (NC), he or she may face a conflict of interest on discussions relating to the succession of the Chairman and should thus recuse himself or herself from such discussions after providing his or her input to the NC on other matters.</p><p>  <strong>Director Competencies</strong></p><p>  There should be formal communication from the company to each of the directors on their appointment and their roles, duties, obligations and responsibilities, and the expectations of the company. This includes each director developing his or her competencies to effectively discharge his or her duties.</p><p>  To ensure that directors have the opportunities to develop their skills and knowledge, the Board should develop a policy and criteria for directors' development. The Chairman and the NC Chairman should jointly and regularly review and agree with each director his or her training and professional development needs.</p><p>  <strong>Board Organisation and Support</strong></p><p>  The Board may form board committees, and decide the scope and the matters delegated to the board committees. Generally, all important decisions should be made at the Board level.</p><p>  If the Board chooses to form an executive committee (EXCO) and delegate certain matters for the EXCO to decide, it is responsible for understanding the EXCO's discussions and endorsing the EXCO's decisions.</p><p>  Management provides the Board with information for its meetings and decision making, including board papers and supporting information. In respect of budgets, any material variance between the projections and actual results should also be disclosed and explained.</p><p>  Relying purely on what is volunteered by Management is unlikely to be enough in all circumstances and further enquiries may be required if the director is to fulfil his or her duties properly. Directors are entitled to request from Management and should be provided with such additional information as needed to make informed decisions. Management should provide the information in a timely manner.</p><p>  The Board should be supported by the company secretary, <span class="me">whose</span> role should be clearly defined. The company secretary's responsibilities include advising the Board on corporate and administrative matters, as well as facilitating orientation and assisting with professional development as required. The company secretary should attend all board meetings.</p>

                <p><strong>Director Independence</strong></p><p>There should be a strong and independent element on the Board.</p><p>An independent director (ID) should have no relationship (whether familial, business, financial, employment, or otherwise) with the company, its related corporations, substantial shareholders<sup>1</sup> or officers, which could interfere or be perceived to interfere with the director's independent judgment.</p><p><a href="/node/4870">Rule 210</a>(5)(d) of the SGX Listing Rules (Mainboard)/ <a href="/node/3306">Rule 406</a>(3)(d) of the SGX Listing Rules (Catalist) sets out the following specific circumstances in which a director should be deemed to be non-independent:</p><div class="list">(a) a director who is or has been employed by the company or any of its related corporations for the current or any of the past three financial years;</div><div class="list">(b) a director who has an immediate family member who is, or has been in any of the past three financial years, employed by the company or any of its related corporations and whose remuneration is determined by the Remuneration Committee (RC); and</div><div class="list">(c) a director who has been a director of the company for an aggregate period of more than nine years (whether before or after listing). Such director may continue to be considered independent until the conclusion of the next annual general meeting of the company.<sup>2</sup></div><p>In addition to these, the Nominating Committee (NC) and Board should consider the following circumstances in which a director should also be deemed to be non-independent:</p><div class="list">(a) a director, or a director whose immediate family member, in the current or immediate past financial year, provided to or received from the company or any of its subsidiaries any significant payments or material services (which may include auditing, banking, consulting and legal services), other than compensation for board service. The amount and nature of the service, and whether it is provided on a one-off or recurring basis, are relevant in determining whether the service provided is material. As a guide, payments aggregated over any financial year in excess of S$50,000 should generally be deemed significant;</div><div class="list">(b) a director, or a director whose immediate family member, in the current or immediate past financial year, is or was, a substantial shareholder or a partner in (with 5% or more stake), or an executive officer of, or a director of, any organisation which provided to or received from the company or any of its subsidiaries any significant payments or material services (which may include auditing, banking, consulting and legal services). The amount and nature of the service, and whether it is provided on a one-off or recurring basis, are relevant in determining whether the service provided is material. As a guide, payments<span class="me"><sup>3</sup></span> aggregated over any financial year in excess of S$200,000 should generally be deemed significant irrespective of whether they constitute a significant portion of the revenue of the organisation in question; or</div><div class="list">(c) a director who is or has been directly associated<sup>4</sup> with a substantial shareholder of the company, in the current or immediate past financial year.</div><p>The above examples are not exhaustive and the NC and Board should determine whether there is any circumstance or relationship which might impact a director's independence, or the perception of his or her independence. Other than the circumstances set out in the SGX Listing Rules, these examples are meant to illustrate situations of likely non-independence and the NC and Board can still consider a director to be independent notwithstanding the existence of any of the above-mentioned situations. However, if the Board, having taking into account the view of the NC, does so, it has to fully disclose the nature of the director's relationship, and why the Board has determined the director to be independent.</p><p><strong>Proportion of Non-Executive Directors</strong></p><p>A key duty of the Board is to set objectives and goals for Management, monitor the results, and assess and remunerate Management on its performance. Executive directors who are part of Management may face conflicts of interest in these areas. To avoid undue influence of Management over the Board and ensure that appropriate checks and balances are in place, non-executive directors should comprise at least a majority of the Board.</p><p><strong>Role of the Lead Independent Director</strong></p><p>The lead independent director (Lead ID) plays an additional facilitative role within the Board, and where necessary, he or she may also facilitate communication between the Board and shareholders or other stakeholders of the company. The company should clearly communicate to shareholders and other stakeholders on how the Lead ID can be contacted.</p><p>The role of the Lead ID may include chairing Board meetings in the absence of the Chairman, working with the Chairman in leading the Board, and providing a channel to non-executive directors for confidential discussions on any concerns and to resolve conflicts of interest as and when necessary. In addition, the Lead ID may also help the NC conduct annual performance evaluation and develop succession plans for the Chairman and CEO and help the RC design and assess the Chairman's remuneration.</p><p><strong>Board Diversity Policy</strong></p><p>Principle 2 requires a board to have an appropriate level of independence and diversity of thought and background in its composition to enable it to make decisions in the best interests of the company.</p><p>Provision 2.4 expands on the concepts of independence and diversity in Principle 2 by stating that the Board and board committees should be of an appropriate size, and comprise directors who as a group provide the appropriate balance and mix of skills, knowledge, experience, and other aspects of diversity such as gender and age, so as to avoid groupthink and foster constructive debate.</p><p>With effect from 1 January 2022, <a href="/node/9136">Rule 710A</a>(1) of the SGX Listing Rules (Mainboard) / <a href="/node/9135">Rule 710A</a>(1) of the SGX Listing Rules (Catalist) requires issuers to maintain a board diversity policy. The rules take reference from the elements of Provision 2.4, and state that a board diversity policy must address gender, skills and experience, and any other relevant aspects of diversity.</p><p>It is recognised that diversity is multi-dimensional in nature, encompassing various aspects. Certain aspects of diversity are widely tracked by investors and other stakeholders globally. The SGX Listing Rules ask that issuers maintain a board diversity policy that minimally addresses gender, skills and experience. Boards may incorporate other aspects of diversity as are relevant for the company.</p><p>To provide investors and other stakeholders with relevant information, <a href="/node/9136">Rule 710A</a>(2) of the SGX Listing Rules (Mainboard) / <a href="/node/9135">Rule 710A</a>(2) of the SGX Listing Rules (Catalist) also requires an issuer to include in the disclosure of its board diversity policy, the following:</p><div class="list">(a) the issuer’s targets to achieve diversity on its Board;</div><div class="list">(b) the issuer’s accompanying plans and timelines for achieving the targets;</div><div class="list">(c) the issuer’s progress towards achieving the targets within the timelines; and</div><div class="list">(d) a description of how the combination of skills, talents, experience and diversity of its directors serves the needs and plans of the issuer.</div><p>The NC is responsible for setting the board diversity policy, including the targets, plans and timelines, for the Board’s approval. The NC should review the progress towards meeting the policy targets and keep the Board updated.</p><p>The board diversity policy should have measurable targets that are numerical or quantitative, to be achieved within an appropriate timeline (for example, achieving specific numerical targets for female representation on its board within a specified time period). The accompanying plans for achieving the targets should describe the concrete steps that the company will undertake. Aspirational or qualitative targets (for example, ‘creating an inclusive culture’) may also be included, but these should also be accompanied with a description of the initiatives to be undertaken to translate the aspiration into results.</p><p>Companies should provide updates on their progress toward their targets by stating what they achieved within the year under report and what is to be achieved beyond the year under report. If companies face challenges in meeting their stated targets within the relevant timelines, they should provide an explanation and describe their plans to overcome these challenges. Companies should strive to build on their achievements each year, and may consider disclosing how their performance relative to their targets has changed over the years.</p><p>The description of how the Board’s combination of skills, talents, experience and diversity serves the needs and plans of the company should be made in the context of the company’s current plans and future strategy.</p><hr style="height:1px;" /><p><sup>1</sup> A "substantial shareholder" is a shareholder who has an interest or interests in one or more voting shares (excluding treasury shares) in the company and the total votes attached to that share, or those shares, is not less than 5% of the total votes attached to all voting shares (excluding treasury shares) in the company, in line with the definition set out in section 2 of the Securities and Futures Act (Chapter 289) of Singapore.</p><p><sup>2</sup> <a href="/node/4870">Rule 210</a>(5)(d)(iv) of the SGX Listing Rules (Mainboard) / <a href="/node/3306">Rule 406</a>(3)(d)(iv) of the SGX Listing Rules (Catalist) takes effect at an issuer’s annual general meeting held for the financial year ending on or after 31 December 2023.

                <p><span class="me"><strong>Selection, Appointment and Re-appointment Process</strong></span></p><p><span class="me">The process for the selection, appointment and re-appointment of directors should take into consideration the composition and progressive renewal of the Board, as well as each director's competencies, commitment, contribution and performance (e.g. attendance, preparedness, participation and candour) including, if applicable, his or her performance as an independent director (ID).</span></p><p>The NC, which is responsible for making recommendations to the Board in relation to the appointment and / or re-appointment of directors, should go beyond the Board’s immediate circle of contacts and use a variety of channels including third party search firms, director associations or advertisements to identify a broader range of suitable candidates.</p><p><span class="me">To facilitate investors' understanding of its nomination process, the Board should disclose the following in the corporate governance section of the company’s annual report:</span></p><div class="list"><span class="me">(a) the channels used in the search and nomination process for identifying appropriate candidates, and the channel via which the eventual appointee was found; and</span></div><div class="list"><span class="me">(b) the criteria used to identify and evaluate potential new directors, including the relevant experience and skillsets to the company's business which are considered, and whether broader search criteria such as diversity and technological expertise are also included.</span></div><p><span class="me">The company should disclose how the Board, with its collection of skills, experience and diversity, meets the needs of the company.</span></p><p><span class="me"><strong>Appointment of Alternate Directors</strong></span></p><p><span class="me">A director should take on a directorship appointment only if he or she is able to commit the time to discharge the duties of a director, one of which includes attending all Board meetings. Alternate directors<sup>4</sup> should only be appointed in exceptional circumstances. In particular, companies should not appoint alternate directors for IDs.</span></p><p><span class="me">Alternate directors bear all the duties and responsibilities of a director. All rules and procedures that apply to directors similarly apply to alternate directors.</span></p><p><span class="me"><strong>Multiple Directorships</strong></span></p><p><span class="me">The responsibilities of a director of a listed company are complex and demanding. Directors need to make the substantial time commitment required to fulfill their responsibilities and duties to the company and its shareholders. A director with other major commitments can be, or be perceived to be, ineffective because he or she is unable to allocate sufficient time to properly discharge his or her duties on the Board.</span></p><p><span class="me">The Board and Nominating Committee (NC) should therefore take into account the number of directorships and principal commitments of each director in assessing whether he is able to or has been adequately carrying out his or her duties. The Board and NC should establish guidelines on what a reasonable and maximum number of such directorships and principal commitments for each director (or type of director) should be. For instance, directors who are full-time executives could have less capacity to take on listed company directorships, as compared to retirees who may be able to focus entirely on directorships. In addition, an appointment as a non-executive chairman of a listed company would likely require more time and commitment as compared to other non-executive directorships.</span></p><p>The Board and NC should take into consideration whether a director had previously served on the board of a company with an adverse track record or with a history of irregularities or is or was under investigation by regulators, and seek clarity on the director’s involvement therein. The Board and NC should also assess whether a director’s resignation from the board of any such company casts any doubt on the director’s qualification and ability to act as a director of the Company.</p><p><span class="me">The Board and NC should also consider other factors in determining the practicality of multiple directorships and principal commitments. For example, scheduling board and committee meetings may be challenging for a director sitting on four boards with similar financial year ends and/or reporting timelines.</span></p><p><strong>Succession Planning</strong></p><p>Provision 4.1(a) states that the NC should make recommendations to the Board on the review of succession planning for directors, in particular the Chairman and the CEO, as well as key management personnel (KMP).</p><p>It may be the practice in some companies for the CEO to take charge of the succession planning for KMP while the NC takes charge of succession planning for directors, the Chairman and the CEO. In such circumstances, the NC should still review the plans that the CEO has made for KMP succession.</p><p>Also, it may be the practice in some companies for a board committee other than the NC to review succession planning for KMP. The Board, having regard to the particular circumstances of the company, has the prerogative to determine that any other board committee should review the plans made for KMP succession.</p><p>In reviewing succession plans, it is necessary to have in mind the company’s strategic priorities and the factors affecting the long-term success of the company.</p><p>In relation to directors, the NC should aim to maintain an optimal Board composition by considering the trends affecting the company, reviewing the skills needed, and identifying gaps (which includes considering whether there is an appropriate level of diversity of thought). The NC may use these considerations to set appointment criteria for successors.</p><p>In relation to KMP succession, the NC, or such other committee determined by the Board, should take an active interest in how key talent is managed within the organization. The committee can consider reviewing the mechanisms for identifying strong candidates and developing them to take on senior positions in the future.</p><p>Different time horizons should be considered for succession planning as follows: (1) long-term planning, to identify competencies needed for the company’s strategy and objectives, (2) medium-term planning, for the orderly replacement of Board members and KMP, and (3) contingency planning, for preparedness against sudden and unforeseen changes.</p><hr style="height:1px;" /><p><span class="me"><sup>4</sup> An alternate director is generally a person who is appointed to attend Board meetings on behalf of a director when the latter (usually referred to as the principal director) is unable to attend. Section 4(1) of the Companies Act defines a "director" to include alternate directors.</span></p>

If necessary, the RC should seek expert advice inside and/or outside the company on remuneration. A key aspect of remuneration is benchmarking with comparable organisations. Such data is often not available in-house. Where such advice is obtained, the company should disclose the name and firm of the remuneration consultant, if any, including whether the remuneration consultant has any relationship with the company that could affect his or her independence and objectivity.</span></p>

                <p><span class="me">A company's remuneration framework should be tailored to the specific role and circumstances of each director and key management personnel (KMP). This ensures an appropriate remuneration level and mix that recognises the performance, potential and responsibilities of these individuals.</span></p><p><span class="me">Performance-related remuneration schemes should take account of the risk policies of the company, be symmetric with risk outcomes and be sensitive to the time horizon of risks. There should be appropriate and meaningful measures for the purpose of assessing executive directors' and KMP's performance.</span></p><p><span class="me">Performance should be measurable, appropriate and meaningful so that they incentivise the right behaviour and values that the company supports. For individuals in control functions (e.g. chief financial officer, chief risk officer, head of the internal audit function), performance measures should be principally based on the achievement of the objectives of their functions. While long-term incentive schemes are generally encouraged for executive directors and KMP, the costs and benefits of such schemes should be carefully evaluated. In normal circumstances, offers of shares or grants of options or other forms of deferred remuneration should vest over a period of time. The use of vesting schedules, whereby only a portion of the benefits can be exercised each year, is strongly encouraged. Executive directors and KMP should be encouraged to hold their shares beyond the vesting period, subject to the need to finance any cost of acquiring the shares and associated tax liability.</span></p><p><span class="me">The Remuneration Committee should also consider implementing schemes to encourage non-executive directors (NEDs) to hold shares in the company so as to better align the interests of such NEDs with the interests of shareholders. However, NEDs should not be over-compensated to the extent that their independence may be compromised.</span></p><p><span class="me">Companies should consider the use of contractual provisions to allow them to reclaim incentive components of remuneration from executive directors and KMP in exceptional circumstances, including for example, misstatement of financial results or misconduct resulting in financial loss to the company.</span></p>

                <p><strong>Dividend policy</strong></p><p>The purpose of having and disclosing a dividend policy is to provide an account of how the board stewards the company’s income to create value for shareholders. A dividend policy explains how the cash generated by the company is allocated, the objectives, risks and constraints considered, and why the allocation is appropriate.</p><p>It is good for a company to announce its dividend policy as this is a factor that investors may generally consider when assessing the company’s expectations of future cash flows and the extent to which those cash flows can be used for reinvestment, may be available for dividends, or can be used for other purposes. This information is a relevant input into investors’ pricing of the company’s shares and can also attract potential investors that are looking for a particular type of company.</p><p>A company would normally consider various factors including its cash and reserves position, business prospects, capital commitments, and projected financial position in deciding whether to declare any dividend and, if so, the level of dividend to be declared. It is helpful to investors when companies that do not intend to distribute dividends nevertheless communicate their considerations for not doing so under their dividend policy disclosure and identify the circumstances that would allow them to do so in the future.</p><p>A dividend policy also provides useful information to assist investors in assessing the company’s expectations of cash flows, its ability and propensity to use that cash flows to pay dividends to investors and thus the suitability of the company’s shares as an investment to the investor. A disclosed dividend policy may encourage the company to exercise greater discipline and consistency in the distribution of dividends to shareholders.</p><p>It is appropriate to review the dividend policy regularly in light of the changing business environment. Factors to consider include capital expenditure needs, growth opportunities, business risk assessments, economic cycles, and changes in regulation or taxation.</p><p><strong>Facilitating shareholder participation at general meetings</strong></p><p><span class="me">While companies are required to meet the minimum notice period for general meetings, companies should consider providing longer notice for meetings, especially when dealing with complex transactions, or where the company has numerous overseas shareholders.</span></p><p><span class="me">Management is encouraged to make a presentation to shareholders to update them on the company's performance, position and prospects at general meetings. Presentation materials should be made available on SGXNET and the company's website for the benefit of shareholders.</span></p><p><span class="me">In order to enhance shareholder participation in general meetings, companies should use their best endeavours to avoid scheduling meetings during peak periods when the meetings may coincide with those of other companies, especially if they have a large shareholder base. Companies should consider other avenues of engaging shareholders, such as through townhall meetings, briefings and roadshows, or webcasting meetings and allowing electronic online voting of shares.</span></p><p><span class="me"><strong>Resolutions</strong></span></p><p><span class="me">In general, resolutions should not be bundled or made inter-conditional on each other. This is to ensure that shareholders are given the right to express their views and exercise their voting rights on each resolution separately. However, in situations where resolutions have to be inter-conditional (such as in meetings to approve a reverse takeover), the company should provide clear explanations.</span></p><p><span class="me">Companies should provide the necessary information on each resolution to enable shareholders to exercise their vote on an informed basis. For resolutions on the election or re-election of directors, companies should provide sufficient information on the background of directors, their contributions to the company, and the board and committee positions they are expected to hold upon election.</span></p><p><span class="me"><strong>Director involvement during general meetings</strong></span></p><p><span class="me">Directors should be present for the entire duration of general meetings. The Chairman of the meeting should facilitate constructive dialogue between shareholders and the Board, Management, external auditors and other relevant professionals. The Chairman should allow specific directors, such as board committee chairs or the lead independent director, to answer queries on matters related to their roles.</span></p><p><span class="me">Directors should take the opportunity to interact with shareholders before and/or after general meetings.</span></p>

Updates that shareholders would find useful include: a discussion of the significant factors that affected the company's interim performance, relevant market trends, and the foreseeable risks and opportunities that may have a material impact on the company's prospects. Such information provides shareholders a better understanding of the company's performance in the context of the current business environment.</span></p><p><span class="me"><strong>Investor relations policy</strong></span></p><p>Maintaining and disclosing an investor relations policy serves to facilitate effective two-way communication between the company and its shareholders. An investor relations policy informs shareholders on how the company will engage them (e.g. interim updates, as described above, or scheduled shareholder engagement events), and how they can communicate with the company (refer to “Mechanisms for contacting the company”, below). Implementing and publicizing these engagement channels on the company’s website enhances accessibility to shareholders.</p><p>A stated investor relations policy also helps to align the stakeholders within the company (e.g. the board, management and the personnel in charge of investor relations) with a coordinated approach to investor engagement.</p><p><strong>Mechanisms for contacting the company</strong></p><p>Companies should have a dedicated investor relations contact, via an online submission form, email address or contact number, through which shareholders are able to ask questions and receive responses in a timely manner. As shareholder concerns are different from business or customer issues, it is appropriate to have separate and dedicated investor relations contact points. It is also appropriate for these contact points to be operated by the company’s investor relations department or company secretary, as they are acquainted with the matters that investors would be concerned with. The board should have the investor relations function provide regular updates on the feedback received from investors.</p><p>Where the company has a lead independent director (Lead ID), the company should provide information as to how shareholders can contact the Lead ID directly, rather than having to go through the company.</p>
